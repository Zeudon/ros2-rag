      "A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages.\n",
      "These are akin to Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu).\n",
      "The purpose of the ROS distributions is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are ready to roll everything forward.\n",
      "Therefore once a distribution is released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full).\n",
      "That generally applies to the whole community, but for âhigherâ level packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid breaking changes.\n",

      "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is an interface that is provided by an âapplicationâ, which in this case is usually a shared library or other language appropriate shared resource. APIs are made up of files that define a contract between the software using the interface and the software providing the interface. These files typically manifest as header files in C and C++ and as Python files in Python. In either case it is important that APIs are grouped and described in documentation and that they are declared as either public or private. Public interfaces are subject to change rules and changes to the public interfaces prompt a new version number of the software that provides them.\n",

arguments for static_transform_publisher\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nstatic_transform_publisher\\nprogram used to take arguments like:\\nros2\\nrun\\ntf2_ros\\nstatic_transform_publisher\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\nfoo\\nbar\\n.\\nThe first three numbers are the translation x, y, and z, the next 4 are the quaternion x, y, z, and w, and the last two arguments are the parent and child frame IDs.\\nWhile this worked, it had a couple of problems:\\nThe user had to specify\\nall\\nof the arguments, even if only setting one number\\nReading the command-line to figure out what it was publishing was tricky\\nTo fix both of these issues, the command-line handling has been changed to use flags instead, and all flags except for\\n--frame-id\\nand\\n--child-frame-id\\nare optional.\\nThus, the above command-line can be simplified to:\\nros2\\nrun\\ntf2_ros\\nstatic_transform_publisher\\n--frame-id\\nfoo\\n--child-frame-id\\nbar\\nTo change just the translation x, the command-line would be:\\nros2\\nrun\\ntf2_ros\\nstatic_transform_publisher\\n--x\\n1.5\\n--frame-id\\nfoo\\n--child-frame-id\\nbar\\n.\\nThe old-style arguments are still allowed in this release, but are deprecated and will print a warning.\\nThey will be removed in future releases.\\nSee\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/392\\nfor more details.\\nTransform listener spin thread no longer executes node callbacks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\ntf2_ros::TransformListener\\nno longer spins on the provided node object.\\nInstead, it creates a callback group to execute callbacks on the entities it creates internally.\\nThis means if you have set the parameter\\nspin_thread=true\\nwhen creating a transform listener, you\\ncan no longer depend on your own callbacks to be executed.\\nYou must call a\\nspin\\nfunction on your node (e.g.\\nrclcpp::spin\\n), or add your node to your own executor.\\nRelated pull request:\\ngeometry2#442\\nrosbag2\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNew playback and recording controls\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSeveral pull requests have been added to enhance the userâ\\x80\\x99s control over playback of bags.\\nPull request\\n931\\nadds the ability to specify a time stamp to begin playing from.\\nDue to pull request\\n789\\nit is now possible to delay the start of playback by a specified interval.\\nRelatedly,\\nrosbag2\\nhas gained new ways for users to control playback as it is happening.\\nPull request\\n847\\nadds keyboard controls for pausing, resuming, and playing the next message during playback from a terminal.\\nIt is also possible to start playback paused thanks to pull requests\\n905\\nand\\n904\\n, which makes it easy for the user to initiate playback and then step through messages, such as when debugging a pipeline.\\nPull request\\n836\\nadds an interface for seeking within bags, allowing the user to move around within a bag during playback.\\nFinally, a new snapshot mode has been added to recording in pull request\\n851\\n.\\nThis mode, useful for incident recording, allows recording to begin filling up buffers, but not begin writing data to disc until a service is called.\\nBurst-mode playback\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhile the playback of data from a bag in real-time is the most well-known use case for bag files, there are situations where you want the data in the bag as fast as possible.\\nWith pull request\\n977\\n,\\nrosbag2\\nhas gained the ability to â\\x80\\x9cburstâ\\x80\\x9d data from the bag.\\nIn burst mode, the data is played back as fast as possible.\\nThis is useful in applications such as machine learning.\\nZero-Copy playback\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBy default, if loaned message can be used, playback messages are published as loaned message.\\nThis can help to reduce the number of data copies, so there is a greater benefit for sending big data.\\nPull request\\n981\\nadds\\n--disable-loan-message\\noption for playback.\\nWait for an acknowledgment\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis new option will wait until all published messages are acknowledged by all subscribers or until the timeout elapses in millisecond before play is terminated.\\nEspecially for the case of sending message with big size in a short time.\\nThis option is valid only if the publisherâ\\x80\\x99s QOS profile is RELIABLE.\\nPull request\\n951\\nadds\\n--wait-for-all-acked\\noption for playback.\\nBag editing\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nrosbag2\\nis taking steps towards enabling the editing of bags, such as removing all messages for one topic or merging multiple bags into a single bag.\\nPull request\\n921\\nadds bag rewriting and the\\nros2\\nbag\\nconvert\\nverb.\\nOther changes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nPull request\\n925\\nmakes\\nrosbag2\\nignore â\\x80\\x9cleaf topicsâ\\x80\\x9d (topics without a publisher) when recording.\\nThese topics will no longer be automatically added to the bag.\\nKnown Issues\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen\\ninstalling ROS 2 on an Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy host\\nit is important to update your system before installing ROS 2 packages.\\nIt is\\nparticularly\\nimportant to make sure that\\nsystemd\\nand\\nudev\\nare updated to the latest available version otherwise installing\\nros-humble-desktop\\n, which depends on\\nlibudev1\\n, could cause the removal of system critical packages.\\nDetails can be found in\\nros2/ros2#1272\\nand\\nLaunchpad #1974196\\nWhen ROS 2 apt repositories are available, ROS 1 packages in Ubuntu are not installable.\\nSome major Linux distributions have started patching Python to install packages to\\n/usr/local\\n, which is breaking some parts of\\nament_package\\nand builds with\\ncolcon\\n.\\nIn particular, using Ubuntu Jammy with\\nsetuptools\\ninstalled from pip will manifest this misbehavior, and is therefore not recommended.\\nThere is currently a\\nproposed

patch release 8, the node\\nfoo\\nwill start with\\nmy_env_var=2\\n, but now it will start with\\nmy_env_var=1\\n.\\nTo opt-out of the new behavior, you can set the argument\\nscoped=False\\non the\\nGroupAction\\n.\\nRelated tickets:\\nros2#1244\\nlaunch#630\\nChanges in Patch Release 7 (2022-02-08)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLaunch set_env frontend behavior change\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nlaunch#468\\ninadvertently changed behavior to the scope of the\\nset_env\\naction in frontend launch files.\\nChanges to environment variables using the\\nset_env\\naction are no longer scoped to parent\\ngroup\\nactions, and instead apply globally.\\nSince it was backported, the change affects this release.\\nWe consider this change a regression and intend to fix the behavior in the next patch release and in future ROS distributions.\\nWe also plan to fix the behavior in Python launch files, which have never scoped setting environment variables properly.\\nRelated issues:\\nros2#1244\\nlaunch#597\\nFix launch frontend parser\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA refactor of the launch frontend parser fixed some\\nissues parsing special characters\\n.\\nAs a result, there has been a small behavior change when it comes to parsing strings.\\nFor example, previously to pass a number as a string you would have to add extra quotation marks (two sets of quotation marks were needed if using a substitution):\\n<!-- results in the string value \"\\'3\\'\" -->\\n<param\\nname=\\n\"foo\"\\nvalue=\\n\"\\'\\'3\\'\\'\"\\n/>\\nAfter the refactor, the above will result in the the string\\n\"\\'\\'3\\'\\'\"\\n(note the extra set of quotation marks).\\nNow, users should use the\\ntype\\nattribute to signal that the value should be interpreted as a string:\\n<param\\nname=\\n\"foo\"\\nvalue=\\n\"3\"\\ntype=\\n\"str\"\\n/>\\nRelated pull requests:\\nlaunch#530\\nlaunch_ros#265\\nFix memory leaks and undefined behavior in rmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAPI was changed in the following header files:\\nrmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp/TypeSupport.hpp\\nrmw_fastrtps_dynamic_cpp/TypeSupport_impl.hpp\\nThough technically they are publically accessible, it is unlikely people are using them directly.\\nTherefore, we decided to break API in order to fix memory leaks and undefined behavior.\\nThe fix was originally submitted in\\nrmw_fastrtps#429\\nand later backported to Foxy in\\nrmw_fastrtps#577\\n.\\nChanges in Patch Release 2 (2020-08-07)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBug in static_transform_publisher\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDuring the development of Foxy, a bug was introduced into the tf2_ros static_transform_publisher program.\\nThe implementation of the order of the Euler angles passed to static_transform_publisher disagrees with the documentation.\\nFoxy patch release 2\\nfixes\\nthe order so that the implementation agrees with the documentation (yaw, pitch, roll).\\nFor users who have started using the initial Foxy release or patch release 1, this means that any launch files that use static_transform_publisher will have to have the command-line order swapped according to the new order.\\nFor users who are coming from ROS 2 Dashing, ROS 2 Eloquent, or ROS 1, no changes need to be made to port to Foxy patch release 2.\\nChanges since the Eloquent release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nClassic CMake vs. modern CMake\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn â\\x80\\x9cclassicâ\\x80\\x9d CMake a package provides CMake variables like\\n<pkgname>_INCLUDE_DIRS\\nand\\n<pkgname>_LIBRARIES\\nwhen being\\nfind_package()\\n-ed.\\nWith\\nament_cmake\\nthat is achieved by calling\\nament_export_include_directories\\nand\\nament_export_libraries\\n.\\nIn combination with\\nament_export_dependencies\\n,\\nament_cmake\\nensures that all include directories and libraries of recursive dependencies are concatenated and included in these variables.\\nIn â\\x80\\x9cmodernâ\\x80\\x9d CMake a package provides an interface target instead (commonly named\\n<pkgname>::<pkgname>\\n) which in itself encapsulates all recursive dependencies.\\nIn order to export a library target to use modern CMake\\nament_export_targets\\nneeds to be called with an export name which is also used when installing the libraries using\\ninstall(TARGETS\\n<libA>\\n<libB>\\nEXPORT\\n<export_name>\\n...)\\n.\\nThe exported interface targets are available through the CMake variable\\n<pkgname>_TARGETS\\n.\\nFor library targets to be exportable like this they must not rely on classic functions affecting global state like\\ninclude_directories()\\nbut set the include directories on the target itself - for the build as well as install environment - using generator expressions, e.g.\\ntarget_include_directories(<target>\\nPUBLIC\\n\"$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/include>\"\\n\"$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>\")\\n.\\nWhen\\nament_target_dependencies\\nis used to add dependencies to a library target the function uses modern CMake targets when they are available.\\nOtherwise it falls back to using classic CMake variables.\\nAs a consequence you should only export modern CMake targets if all dependencies are also providing modern CMake targets.\\nOtherwise the exported interface target will contain the absolute paths to include directories / libraries in the generated CMake logic which makes the package non-relocatable.\\nFor examples how packages have been updated to modern CMake in Foxy see\\nros2/ros2#904\\n.\\nament_export_interfaces replaced by ament_export_targets\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe CMake function\\nament_export_interfaces\\nfrom the package\\nament_cmake_export_interfaces\\nhas been deprecated in favor of the function\\nament_export_targets\\nin the new package\\nament_cmake_export_targets\\n.\\nSee the GitHub ticket\\nament/ament_cmake#237\\nfor more context.\\nrosidl_generator_c|cpp namespace / API changes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe packages\\nrosidl_generator_c\\nand\\nrosidl_generator_cpp\\nhave been refactored with many headers and sources moved into the new packages\\nrosidl_runtime_c\\nand\\nrosidl_runtime_cpp\\n.\\nThe intention is to remove run dependencies on the generator packages and therefore the code generation tools using Python.\\nWhile moving the headers the include paths / namespaces were updated accordingly so in many cases changing include directives from the generator package to the runtime package is sufficient.\\nThe generated C / C++ code has also been refactored.\\nThe files ending in\\n__struct.h|hpp\\n,\\n__functions.h\\n,\\n__traits.hpp\\n, etc. have been moved into a subdirectory\\ndetail\\nbut most code only includes the header named after the interface without any of these suffixes.\\nSome types regarding string and sequence bounds have also been renamed to match the naming conventions but they arenâ\\x80\\x99t expected to be used in user code (above RMW implementation and type support packages)\\nFor more information see\\nros2/rosidl#446 (for C)\\nand\\nros2/rosidl#447 (for C++)\\n.\\nDefault working directory for ament_add_test\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe default working directory for tests added with\\nament_add_test\\nhas been changed to\\nCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\\nto match the behavior of CMake\\nadd_test\\n.\\nEither update the tests to work with the new default or pass\\nWORKING_DIRECTORY\\n${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}\\nto restore the previous value.\\nDefault Console Logging Format\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe default console logging output format was changed to include the timestamp by default, see:\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/190\\nhttps://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-logging-format/11549\\nDefault Console Logging Output Stream\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs of Foxy, all logging messages at all severity levels get logged to stderr by default.\\nThis ensures that logging messages come out immediately, and brings the ROS 2 logging system into alignment with most other logging systems.\\nIt is possible to change the stream to stdout at runtime via the RCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT environment variable, but all logging messages will still go to the same

Geochelone\\nNew features in this ROS 2 release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAbility to specify per-logger log levels\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is now possible to specify different logging levels for different loggers on the command line:\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\ntalker\\n--ros-args\\n--log-level\\nWARN\\n--log-level\\ntalker:\\n=\\nDEBUG\\nThe above command sets a global log level of WARN, but sets the log level of the talker node messages to DEBUG.\\nThe\\n--log-level\\ncommand-line option can be passed an arbitrary number of times to set different log levels for each logger.\\nAbility to configure logging directory through environment variables\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is now possible to configure the logging directory through two environment variables:\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\nand\\nROS_HOME\\n.\\nThe logic is as follows:\\nUse\\n$ROS_LOG_DIR\\nif\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\nis set and not empty.\\nOtherwise, use\\n$ROS_HOME/log\\n, using\\n~/.ros\\nfor\\nROS_HOME\\nif not set or if empty.\\nThus the default value stays the same:\\n~/.ros/log\\n.\\nRelated PRs:\\nros2/rcl_logging#53\\nand\\nros2/launch#460\\n.\\nFor example:\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\n=\\n/tmp/foo\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\ntalker\\nWill place all

CMake\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is now straightforward to invoke the\\nrosidl\\ninterface generation pipeline outside CMake.\\nSource code generators and interface definition translators are accessible through a unified command line interface.\\nFor example, given a\\nDemo\\nmessage in some\\ndemo\\npackage like:\\nmkdir\\n-p\\ndemo/msg\\ncd\\ndemo\\ncat\\n<< EOF > msg/Demo.msg\\nstd_msgs/Header header\\ngeometry_msgs/Twist twist\\ngeometry_msgs/Accel accel\\nEOF\\nit is easy to generate C, C++, and Python support source

translated message definition will be put in the\\ngen\\ndirectory.\\nNote that these tools generate sources but do not build it â\\x80\\x93 that responsibility is still on the caller.\\nThis is a first step towards enabling\\nrosidl\\ninterface generation in build systems other than CMake.\\nSee the\\ndesign document\\nfor further reference and next steps.\\nExternally configure QoS at start-up\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is now possible to externally configure the QoS settings for a node at start-up time.\\nQoS settings are\\nnot\\nconfigurable during runtime; they are only configurable at start-up.\\nNode authors must opt-in to enable changing QoS settings at start-up.\\nIf the feature is enabled on a node, then QoS settings can be set with ROS parameters when a node first starts.\\nDemos in C++ and Python can be found here.\\nSee the\\ndesign document for more details\\n.\\nNote, user code handling parameter changes with registered callbacks should avoid rejecting updates for unknown parameters.\\nIt was considered bad practice prior to Galactic, but with externally configurable QoS enabled it will result in a hard failure.\\nRelated PRs:\\nros2/rclcpp#1408\\nand\\nros2/rclpy#635\\nPython point_cloud2 utilities available\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSeveral utilities for interacting with\\nPointCloud2 messages\\nin Python were\\nported to ROS

array or sequence.\\nThis only affects authors of rmw implementations using the introspection typesupport.\\nFor further details, see\\nros2/rosidl#531\\n.\\nrcl_lifecycle and rclcpp_lifecycle\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRCLâ\\x80\\x99s lifecycle state machine gets new init API\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe lifecycle state machine in rcl_lifecycle was modified to expect a newly introduced options struct, combining general configurations for the state machine.\\nThe option struct allows to indicate whether the state machine shall be initialized with default values, whether its attached services are active and which allocator to be used.\\nrcl_ret_t\\nrcl_lifecycle_state_machine_init\\n(\\nrcl_lifecycle_state_machine_t\\n*\\nstate_machine\\n,\\nrcl_node_t\\n*\\nnode_handle\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_message_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_pub_notify\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_service_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_srv_change_state\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_service_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_srv_get_state\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_service_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_srv_get_available_states\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_service_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_srv_get_available_transitions\\n,\\nconst\\nrosidl_service_type_support_t\\n*\\nts_srv_get_transition_graph\\n,\\nconst\\nrcl_lifecycle_state_machine_options_t\\n*\\nstate_machine_options\\n);\\nRCLâ\\x80\\x99s lifecycle state machine stores allocator instance\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe options struct (discussed above) entails an instance of the allocator being used for initializing the state machine.\\nThis options struct and there the embodied allocator are being stored within the lifecycle state machine.\\nAs a direct consequence, the\\nrcl_lifecycle_fini\\nfunction\\nno longer expects an allocator in its fini function but rather uses the allocator set in the options struct for deallocating its internal data

It would be better if there was a way to skip the tests by default in such a way that they could be specifically un-skipped at runtime, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t find a mechanism in CMake or CTest that would allow us to achieve that behavior without leveraging environment variables.\\nHandle Google Benchmark â\\x80\\x98aggregateâ\\x80\\x99 results (\\n#276\\n) Previously, I assumed all results generated by Google Benchmark were of â\\x80\\x98iterationâ\\x80\\x99 type. Now that I have more experience with Google Benchmark, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve started generating aggregate results, which contain some different properties. This change adds support for aggregate results and should make it easy to add any other result schemas we encounter in the future. For forward-compatibility, unsupported types will generate a warning message but will not fail the test.

In the existing implementation, the wrapper detects that no result file was generated and overrides the special return code coming from the test, making the the CTest feature fail completely. This change makes the wrapper script aware of the special return code, and when detected, will write a â\\x80\\x98skippedâ\\x80\\x99 result file instead of a â\\x80\\x98failedâ\\x80\\x99 result file, and pass along the special return code as-is. Now the gtest result and the ctest results both show the test as â\\x80\\x98skippedâ\\x80\\x99 when the special return flag is used. Note that none of this behavior is enabled by default, which is important because we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want a test to fail and return a code which weâ\\x80\\x99ve decided is the special â\\x80\\x98skipâ\\x80\\x99 return code. Only tests which are aware of this feature should use it.\\nContributors: Dirk Thomas, Michel Hidalgo, Ruffin, Scott K Logan\\nament_cmake_uncrustify\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRemove Claire as a maintainer.

(\\n#260\\n) Replace it with the use of the more modern importlib_metadata library.  There are a couple of reasons to do this: 1.  pkg_resources is quite slow to import; on my machine, just firing up the python interpreter takes ~35ms, while firing up the python interpreter and importing pkg_resources takes ~175ms.  Firing up the python interpreter and importing importlib_metadata takes ~70ms.  Removing 100ms per invocation of the command-line both makes it speedier for users, and will speed up our tests (which call out to the command-line quite a lot). 2.  pkg_resources is somewhat deprecated and being replaced by importlib.\\nhttps://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html\\ndescribes some of it Note: By itself, this change is not enough to completely remove our dependence on pkg_resources.  Weâ\\x80\\x99ll also have to do something about the console_scripts that setup.py generates.  That will be a separate effort.\\nAdd pytest.ini so local tests donâ\\x80\\x99t display warning.

detail:\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/160\\nrclcpp\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAPI Break with\\nget_actual_qos()\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIntroduced in Dashing, the\\nget_actual_qos()\\nmethod on the\\nPublisherBase\\nand\\nSubscriptionBase\\npreviously returned an rmw type,\\nrmw_qos_profile_t\\n, but that made it awkward to reuse with the creation of other entities.\\nTherefore it was updated to return a\\nrclcpp::QoS\\ninstead.\\nExisting code will need to use the\\nrclcpp::QoS::get_rmw_qos_profile()\\nmethod if the rmw profile is still required.\\nFor example:\\nvoid\\nmy_func\\n(\\nconst\\nrmw_qos_profile_t\\n&\\nrmw_qos\\n);\\n/* Previously: */\\n// my_func(some_pub->get_actual_qos());\\n/* Now: */\\nmy_func\\n(\\nsome_pub\\n->\\nget_actual_qos\\n()\\n->\\nget_rmw_qos_profile\\n());\\nThe rationale for breaking this directly rather than doing a tick-tock is that it is a new function and is expected to be used infrequently by users.\\nAlso, since only the return type is changing, adding a new function with a different would be to only way to do a deprecation cycle and\\nget_actual_qos()\\nis the most appropriate name, so we would be forced to pick a less obvious name for the method.\\nAPI Break with Publisher and Subscription Classes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn an effort to streamline the construction of Publishers and Subscriptions, the API of the constructors were changed.\\nIt would be impossible to support a deprecation cycle, because the old signature takes an rcl type and the new one takes the\\nNodeBaseInterface\\ntype so that it can get additional information it now needs, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way to get the additional information needed from just the rcl type.\\nThe new signature could possibly be backported if that would help contributors, but since the publishers and subscriptions are almost always created using the factory functions or some other higher level API, we do not expect this to be a problem for most users.\\nPlease see the original pr for more detail and comment there if this causes issues:\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/867\\nCompiler warning about unused result of\\nadd_on_set_parameters_callback\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSince Eloquent Patch Release 2 (2020-12-04)\\nUsers should

Options\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nrmw_create_publisher()\\nmethod had a new argument added of type\\nconst\\nrmw_publisher_options_t\\n*\\n.\\nThis new structure holds options (beyond the typesupport, topic name, and QoS) for new publishers.\\nThe\\nrmw_create_subscription()\\nmethod had one argument removed,\\nbool\\nignore_local_publications\\n, and replaced by the new options of type\\nconst\\nrmw_subscription_options_t\\n*\\n.\\nThe\\nignore_local_publications\\noption was moved into the new\\nrmw_subscription_options_t\\ntype.\\nIn both cases the new argument, which are pointers, may never be null, and so the rmw implementations should check to make sure the options are not null.\\nAdditionally, the options should be copied into the corresponding rmw structure.\\nSee

some_package some_node --ros-args --remap foo:=bar --params-file /path/to/params.yaml --log-level WARN -- --user-flag\\nThis explicit syntax affords new features, like single parameter assignment\\n--param\\nname:=value\\n.\\nFor further reference and rationale, check the\\nROS command line arguments design document\\n.\\nWarning\\nFormer syntax has been deprecated and is due for

release\\n.\\nPlease see the\\nDashing meta ticket\\non GitHub, which contains more information as well as references to specific tickets with additional details.\\nChanges since the Crystal release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDeclaring Parameters\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere have been some changes to the behavior of parameters starting in Dashing, which have also lead to some new APIâ\\x80\\x99s and the deprecation of other APIâ\\x80\\x99s.\\nSee the\\nrclcpp\\nand\\nrclpy\\nsections below for more information about API changes.\\nGetting and Setting Undeclared Parameters\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs of Dashing, parameters now need to be declared before being accessed or set.\\nBefore Dashing, you could call\\nget_parameter(name)\\nand get either a value, if it had been previously set, or a parameter of type\\nPARAMETER_NOT_SET\\n.\\nYou could also call\\nset_parameter(name,\\nvalue)\\nat any point, even if the parameter was previously unset.\\nSince Dashing, you need to first declare a parameter before getting or setting it.\\nIf you try to get or set an undeclared parameter you will either get an exception thrown, e.g. ParameterNotDeclaredException, or in certain cases you will get an unsuccessful result communicated in a variety of ways (see specific functions for more details).\\nHowever, you can get the old behavior (mostly, see the note in the next paragraph) by using the\\nallow_undeclared_parameters\\noption when creating your node.\\nYou might want to do this in order to avoid code changes for now, or in order to fulfill some uncommon use cases.\\nFor example, a â\\x80\\x9cglobal parameter serverâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cparameter blackboardâ\\x80\\x9d may want to allow external nodes to set new parameters on itself without first declaring them, so it may use the\\nallow_undeclared_parameters\\noption to accomplish that.\\nIn most cases, however, this option is not recommended because it makes the rest of the parameter API less safe to bugs like parameter name typos and â\\x80\\x9cuse before setâ\\x80\\x9d logical errors.\\nNote that using\\nallow_undeclared_parameters\\nwill get you most of the old behavior specifically for â\\x80\\x9cgetâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9csetâ\\x80\\x9d methods, but it will not revert all the behavior changes related to parameters back to how it was for ROS Crystal.\\nFor that you need to also set the\\nautomatically_declare_parameters_from_overrides\\noption to\\ntrue\\n, which is described below in\\nParameter Configuration using a YAML File\\n.\\nDeclaring a Parameter with a ParameterDescriptor\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAnother benefit to declaring your parameters before using them, is that it allows you to declare a parameter descriptor at the same time.\\nNow when declaring a parameter you may include a custom\\nParameterDescriptor\\nas well as a name and default value.\\nThe\\nParameterDescriptor\\nis defined as a message in\\nrcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterDescriptor\\nand contains meta data like\\ndescription\\nand constraints like\\nread_only\\nor\\ninteger_range\\n.\\nThese constraints can be used to reject invalid values when setting parameters and/or as hints to external tools about what values are valid for a given parameter.\\nThe\\nread_only\\nconstraint will prevent the parameterâ\\x80\\x99s value from changing after being declared, as well as prevent if from being undeclared.\\nFor reference, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a link to the\\nParameterDescriptor\\nmessage as of the time of writing this:\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/blob/0aba5a142878c2077d7a03977087e7d74d40ee68/rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterDescriptor.msg#L1\\nParameter Configuration using a YAML File\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs of Dashing, parameters in a YAML configuration file, e.g. passed to the node via the command line argument\\n__params:=\\n, are only used to override a parameterâ\\x80\\x99s default value when declaring the parameter.\\nBefore Dashing, any parameters you passed via a YAML file would be implicitly set on the node.\\nSince Dashing, this is no longer the case, as parameters need to be declared in order to appear on the node to external observers, like\\nros2\\nparam\\nlist\\n.\\nThe old behavior may be achieved using the\\nautomatically_declare_parameters_from_overrides\\noption when creating a node.\\nThis option, if set to\\ntrue\\n, will automatically declare all parameters in the input YAML file when the node is constructed.\\nThis may be used to avoid major changes to your existing code or to serve specific use cases.\\nFor example, a â\\x80\\x9cglobal parameter serverâ\\x80\\x9d may want to be seeded with arbitrary parameters on launch, which it could not have declared ahead of time.\\nMost of the time, however, this option is not recommended, as it may lead to setting a parameter in a YAML file with the assumption that the node will use it, even if the node does not actually use it.\\nIn the future we hope to have a checker that will warn you if you pass a parameter to a node that it was not expecting.\\nThe parameters in the YAML file will continue to influence the value of parameters when they are first declared.\\nament_cmake\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe CMake function\\nament_index_has_resource\\nwas returning either\\nTRUE\\nor\\nFALSE\\n.\\nAs of\\nthis release\\nit returns either the prefix path in case the resource was found or\\nFALSE\\n.\\nIf you are using the return value in a CMake condition like this:\\nament_index_has_resource\\n(\\nvar\\n...\\n)\\nif\\n(\\n${\\nvar\\n}\\n)\\nyou need to update the condition to ensure it considers a string value as\\nTRUE\\n:\\nif\\n(\\nvar\\n)\\nrclcpp\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBehavior Change for\\nNode::get_node_names()\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe function\\nNodeGraph::get_node_names()\\n, and therefore also\\nNode::get_node_names()\\n, now returns a\\nstd::vector<std::string>\\ncontaining fully qualified node names with their namespaces included, instead of just the node names.\\nChanged the Way that Options are Passed to Nodes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nExtended arguments (beyond name and namespace) to the\\nrclcpp::Node()\\nconstructor have been replaced with a\\nrclcpp::NodeOptions\\nstructure.\\nSee\\nros2/rclcpp#622\\nfor details about the structure and default values of the options.\\nIf you are using any of the extended arguments to\\nrclcpp::Node()\\nlike this:\\nauto\\ncontext\\n=\\nrclcpp\\n::\\ncontexts\\n::\\ndefault_context\\n::\\nget_global_default_context\\n();\\nstd\\n::\\nvector\\n<\\nstd\\n::\\nstring\\n>\\nargs\\n;\\nstd\\n::\\nvector\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nParameter\\n>\\nparams\\n=\\n{\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nParameter\\n(\\n\"use_sim_time\"\\n,\\ntrue\\n)\\n};\\nauto\\nnode\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nNode\\n>\\n(\\n\"foo_node\"\\n,\\n\"bar_namespace\"\\n,\\ncontext\\n,\\nargs\\n,\\nparams\\n);\\nYou

to Creating Publishers and Subscriptions\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere have been a few changes to creating publishers and subscriptions which are new in Dashing:\\nQoS settings are now passed using the new\\nrclcpp::QoS\\nclass, and the API encourages the user to specify at least the history depth.\\nOptions are now passed as an object, i.e.\\nrclcpp::PublisherOptions\\nand\\nrclcpp::SubscriptionOptions\\n.\\nAll changes are backwards compatible (no code changes are required), but several existing call styles have been deprecated.\\nUsers are encouraged to update to the new signatures.\\nIn the past, when creating a publisher or subscription, you could either not specify any QoS settings (e.g. just provide topic name for a publisher) or you could specify a â\\x80\\x9cqos profileâ\\x80\\x9d data structure (of type\\nrmw_qos_profile_t\\n) with all the settings already set.\\nNow you must use the new\\nrclcpp::QoS\\nobject to specify your QoS and at least the history settings for your QoS.\\nThis encourages the user to specify a history depth when using\\nKEEP_LAST\\n, rather than defaulting it to a value that may or may not be appropriate.\\nIn ROS 1, this was known as the\\nqueue_size\\nand it was required in both C++ and Python.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re changing the ROS 2 API to bring this requirement back.\\nAlso, any options which could previously be passed during creation of a publisher or subscription have now been encapsulated in an\\nrclcpp::PublisherOptions\\nand\\nrclcpp::SubscriptionOptions\\nclass respectively.\\nThis allows for shorter signatures, more convenient use, and for adding new future options without breaking API.\\nSome signatures for creating publishers and subscribers are now deprecated, and new signatures have been added to allow you to use the new\\nrclcpp::QoS\\nand publisher/subscription option classes.\\nThese are the new and recommended

change to how QoS is passed is most likely to impact users.\\nA typical change for a publisher looks like this:\\n- pub_ = create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(\"chatter\");\\n+ pub_ = create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::String>(\"chatter\", 10);\\nAnd for a subscription:\\n- sub_ = create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::String>(\"chatter\", callback);\\n+ sub_ = create_subscription<std_msgs::msg::String>(\"chatter\", 10, callback);\\nIf you have no idea what depth to use and donâ\\x80\\x99t care right now (maybe just prototyping), then we recommend using\\n10\\n, as that was the default before and should preserve existing behavior.\\nMore in depth documentation about how to select an appropriate depth is forthcoming.\\nThis is an example of a slightly more involved change to avoid the newly deprecated APIâ\\x80\\x99s:\\n- // Creates a latched topic\\n- rmw_qos_profile_t qos = rmw_qos_profile_default;\\n- qos.depth = 1;\\n- qos.durability = RMW_QOS_POLICY_DURABILITY_TRANSIENT_LOCAL;\\n-\\nmodel_xml_.data = model_xml;\\nnode_handle->declare_parameter(\"robot_description\", model_xml);\\ndescription_pub_ =

composition, see\\nthe tutorial\\nrclpy\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nChanges to Creating Publishers, Subscriptions, and QoS Profiles\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nPrior to Dashing, you could optionally provide a\\nQoSProfile\\nobject when creating a publisher or subscription.\\nIn an effort to encourage users to specify a history depth for message queues, we now\\nrequire\\nthat a depth value or\\nQoSProfile\\nobject is given when creating publishers or subscriptions.\\nTo create a publisher, previously you would have written:\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_publisher\\n(\\nEmpty\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n)\\n# Or using a keyword argument for QoSProfile\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_publisher\\n(\\nEmpty\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nqos_profile\\n=\\nqos_profile_sensor_data\\n)\\nIn Dashing, prefer the following API that provides a depth value or\\nQoSProfile\\nobject as a third positional argument:\\n# Assume a history setting of KEEP_LAST with depth 10\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_publisher\\n(\\nEmpty\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\n10\\n)\\n# Or pass a QoSProfile object directly\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_publisher\\n(\\nEmpty\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nqos_profile_sensor_data\\n)\\nLikewise for subscriptions, previously you would have written:\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nBasicTypes\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nlambda\\nmsg\\n:\\nprint\\n(\\nmsg\\n))\\n# Or using a keyword argument for QoSProfile\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nBasicTypes\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nlambda\\nmsg\\n:\\nprint\\n(\\nmsg\\n),\\nqos_profile\\n=\\nqos_profile_sensor_data\\n)\\nIn Dashing:\\n# Assume a history setting of KEEP_LAST with depth 10\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nBasicTypes\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nlambda\\nmsg\\n:\\nprint\\n(\\nmsg\\n),\\n10\\n)\\n# Or pass a QoSProfile object directly\\nnode\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nBasicTypes\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nlambda\\nmsg\\n:\\nprint\\n(\\nmsg\\n),\\nqos_profile_sensor_data\\n)\\nTo ease the transition, users who do not use the new API will see deprecation warnings.\\nFurthermore, we also require that when constructing\\nQoSProfile\\nobjects that a history policy and/or depth is set.\\nIf a history policy of\\nKEEP_LAST\\nis provided, then a depth argument is also required.\\nFor example, these calls are valid:\\nQoSProfile\\n(\\nhistory\\n=\\nQoSHistoryPolicy\\n.\\nRMW_QOS_POLICY_HISTORY_KEEP_ALL\\n)\\nQoSProfile\\n(\\nhistory\\n=\\nQoSHistoryPolicy\\n.\\nRMW_QOS_POLICY_HISTORY_KEEP_LAST\\n,\\ndepth\\n=\\n10\\n)\\nQoSProfile\\n(\\ndepth\\n=\\n10\\n)\\n# equivalent to the previous line\\nAnd these calls will cause a deprecation warning:\\nQoSProfile\\n()\\nQoSProfile\\n(\\nreliability\\n=\\nQoSReliabilityPolicy\\n.\\nRMW_QOS_POLICY_RELIABILITY_BEST_EFFORT\\n)\\n# KEEP_LAST but no depth\\nQoSProfile\\n(\\nhistory\\n=\\nQoSHistoryPolicy\\n.\\nRMW_QOS_POLICY_HISTORY_KEEP_LAST\\n)\\nSee the issue and pull request related to introducing this change for more

declared:\\ndef\\nget_parameter_or\\n(\\nname\\n:\\nstr\\n,\\nalternative_value\\n:\\nOptional\\n[\\nParameter\\n]\\n=\\nNone\\n)\\n->\\nParameter\\nOther changes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nrclpy.parameter.Parameter\\ncan now guess its type without explicitly setting it (as long as itâ\\x80\\x99s one of the supported ones by\\nrcl_interfaces.msg.ParameterValue\\n).\\nFor example, this code:\\np\\n=\\nParameter\\n(\\n\\'myparam\\'\\n,\\nParameter\\n.\\nType\\n.\\nDOUBLE\\n,\\n2.41\\n)\\nIs equivalent to this code:\\np\\n=\\nParameter\\n(\\n\\'myparam\\'\\n,\\nvalue\\n=\\n2.41\\n)\\nThis change does not break existing API.\\nrosidl\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nUntil Crystal each message generator package registered itself using the\\nament_cmake\\nextension point\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\nand was passed a set of\\n.msg\\n/\\n.srv\\n/\\n.action\\nfiles.\\nAs of Dashing the message generation pipeline is based on\\n.idl\\nfiles instead.\\nAny message generator package needs to change and register itself using the new extension point\\nrosidl_generate_idl_interfaces\\nwhich passes only\\n.idl\\nfiles instead.\\nThe message generators for the commonly supported languages C, C++, and Python as well as the typesupport packages for introspection, Fast RTPS, Connext and OpenSplice have already been updated (see\\nros2/rosidl#334\\n).\\nThe CMake code calling\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces()\\ncan either pass\\n.idl\\nfiles directly or pass\\n.msg\\n/\\n.srv\\n/\\n.action\\nwhich will then internally be converted into\\n.idl\\nfiles before being passed to each message generator.\\nThe format of\\n.msg\\n/\\n.srv\\n/\\n.action\\nfiles is not being evolved in the future.\\nThe mapping between\\n.msg\\n/\\n.srv\\n/\\n.action\\nfiles and\\n.idl\\nfiles is described in\\nthis design article\\n.\\nA\\nsecond design article\\ndescribes the supported features in\\n.idl\\nfiles.\\nIn order to leverage any of the new features existing interfaces need to be converted (e.g. using the command line tools\\nmsg2idl\\n/\\nsrv2idl\\n/\\naction2idl\\n).\\nTo distinguish same type names, but with different namespaces, the introspection structs now contain a namespace field that replaces the package name (see\\nros2/rosidl#335\\n).\\nMapping of char in .msg files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn\\nROS 1\\nchar\\nhas been deprecated for a long time and is being mapped to\\nuint8\\n.\\nIn ROS 2 until Crystal\\nchar\\nwas mapped to a single character (\\nchar\\nin C / C++,\\nstr\\nwith length 1 in Python) in an effort to provide a more natural mapping.\\nAs of Dashing the ROS 1 semantic has been restored and\\nchar\\nmaps to\\nuint8\\nagain.\\nrosidl_generator_cpp\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe C++ data structures generated for messages, services and actions provide setter methods for each field.\\nUntil Crystal each setter returned a pointer to the data structure itself to enable the named parameter idiom.\\nAs of Dashing these setters\\nreturn a reference\\ninstead since that seems to be the more common signature as well as it clarifies that the returned value canâ\\x80\\x99t be a\\nnullptr\\n.\\nrosidl_generator_py\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nUntil Crystal an array (fixed size) or sequence (dynamic size, optionally with an upper boundary) field in a message was stored as a\\nlist\\nin Python.\\nAs of Dashing the Python type for arrays / sequences of numeric values has been changed:\\nan array of numeric values is stored as a\\nnumpy.ndarray\\n(the\\ndtype\\nis chosen to match the type of the numeric value)\\na sequence of numeric values is stored as an\\narray.array\\n(the\\ntypename\\nis chosen to match the type of the numeric value)\\nAs before an array / sequence of non-numeric types is still represented as a\\nlist\\nin Python.\\nThis change brings a number of benefits:\\nThe new data structures ensure that each item in the array / sequence complies with the value range restrictions of the numeric type.\\nThe numeric values can be stored more efficiently in memory which avoid the overhead of Python objects for each item.\\nThe memory layout of both data structures allows to read and write all items of the array / sequence in a single operation which makes the conversion from and to Python significantly faster / more efficient.\\nlaunch\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nlaunch_testing\\npackage caught up with the\\nlaunch\\npackage redesign done in Bouncy Bolson.\\nThe legacy Python API, already moved into the\\nlaunch.legacy\\nsubmodule, has thus been deprecated and removed.\\nSee\\nlaunch\\nexamples\\nand\\ndocumentation\\nfor reference on how to use its new API.\\nSee\\ndemos tests\\nfor reference on how to use the new\\nlaunch_testing\\nAPI.\\nrmw\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nChanges since the\\nCrystal Clemmys\\nrelease:\\nNew API in\\nrmw\\n, a fini function

structs, the\\nrcl_context_t\\nand the\\nrcl_init_options_t\\n, which are used with\\nrmw_init\\n.\\nThe init options struct is used to pass options down to the middleware and is an input to\\nrmw_init\\n.\\nThe context is a handle which is an output of\\nrmw_init\\nfunction is used to identify which init-shutdown cycle each entity is associated with, where an â\\x80\\x9centityâ\\x80\\x9d is anything created like a node, guard condition, etc.\\nThis is listed here because maintainers of alternative rmw implementations will need to implement these new functions to have their rmw implementation work in Crystal.\\nThis is the function that had a signature change:\\nrmw_init\\nAdditionally, there are these new functions which need to be implemented by each rmw implementation:\\nrmw_shutdown\\nrmw_init_options_init\\nrmw_init_options_copy\\nrmw_init_options_fini\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s an example of what minimally needs to be changed in an rmw

in\\nrcl\\ncalled\\nrcl_context_t\\nand\\nrcl_init_options_t\\n.\\nThe init options are passed into\\nrcl_init\\nas an input and the context is passed in as an output.\\nThe context is used to associate all other rcl entities to a specific init-shutdown cycle, effectively making init and shutdown no longer global functions, or rather those functions no longer use an global state and instead encapsulate all state within the context type.\\nAny maintainers of a client library implementation (that also uses\\nrcl\\nunder the hood) will need to make changes to work with Crystal.\\nThese functions were removed:\\nrcl_get_global_arguments\\nrcl_get_instance_id\\nrcl_ok\\nThese functions had signature changes:\\nrcl_init\\nrcl_shutdown\\nrcl_guard_condition_init\\nrcl_guard_condition_init_from_rmw\\nrcl_node_init\\nrcl_timer_init\\nThese are the new functions and

       "  'content': \"Warning\\nYou're reading the documentation for a version of ROS 2 that has reached its EOL (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported.\\n        If you want up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nDevelopment process for a release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEach ROS 2 distribution goes through a process of development more than a year long that begins prior to the release of the previous distribution.\\nBelow is a high-level view of this development process.\\nThere is no specific due date for the items in this process, but in general earlier items should be completed before later items can be completed.\\nFor the progress through this process for a specific release, see that releaseâ\\x80\\x99s documentation page.\\nItem\\nNotes\\nFind the ROS Boss\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cROS Bossâ\\x80\\x9d is the person in charge of shepherding a distribution through the development, release, update, and EOLâ\\x80\\x99ing stages of its life. They are chosen from the internal ROS 2 team at Open Robotics.\\nRun process to choose the distribution name\\nThe ROS Boss curates the process of choosing the distributionâ\\x80\\x99s name, using input from sources such as the community and potential naming conflicts.\\nCreate distributionâ\\x80\\x99s documentation page\\nEvery distribution has a documentation page that lists its vital statistics, such as planned release date, EOL date, and significant changes since the previous release.\\nSet release timeline\\nThe final weeks leading up to release day (usually, World Turtle Day) are hectic and full of deadlines, such as when to freeze the default RMW implementation. These deadlines must be planned well in advance.\\nProduce roadmap\\nWhile every contributor to ROS has their own planned features for each distribution, we try to maintain an overall roadmap of the new features and significant changes we expect to see in the distribution. The ROS Boss and the leader of the ROS 2 development team at Open Robotics work together with the ROS 2 TSC and other interested parties to produce a roadmap that is achievable in the time available and meets the needs of the ROS community.\\nAnnounce roadmap\\nThe list of planned features and significant changes is made public, via a GitHub issue that will track the progress on developing each item in the roadmap. Of course, this does not mean that the roadmap is fixed at this point, as development plans can change and we always (and frequently do) welcome new contributions even if they are not on the planned roadmap.\\nSet target platforms and major dependencies\\nThe target platforms, in terms of operating system, distribution and version, must be set far enough in advance for development work on the infrastructure (such as support in the build farm) to proceed. Similarly, the versions of each major dependency (which Python version, which compiler(s), which version of Eigen, etc.) must also be fixed. This is done via an update to\\nREP-2000\\n.\\nAdd platform support to the build farm\\nThe build farm is a critical part of the infrastructure supporting a ROS 2 distribution. It provides continuous integration facilities that help us maintain quality, and it builds the binary packages the community relies on to avoid building ROS 2 and packages from source. If the target platforms differ from the previous ROS 2 distribution, then the necessary support must be added to the build farm.\\nCommission logo and related artwork\\nA well-loved part of every ROS 2 distribution (and ROS distribution!) is the logo. The logo is commissioned from a professional artist based on the chosen distribution name. Based on the logo, other artwork such as the turtlesim icon are also produced.\\nCreate mailing list for the distribution\\nVital for making critical announcements, a mailing list must be set up to contact people interested in knowing something about the distribution, such as that their package is failing to build into a binary on the build farm.\\nCreate test cases\\nAs the development process enters the final few months, testing begins in earnest. The integration test cases that will be used during the final stages of development must be produced and provided to the release team who will be responsible for executing them.\\nAnnounce upcoming RMW freeze\\nThe RMW freeze is the point at which the default RMW implementation for the new distribution is feature-frozen. This gives developers a stable target to test their packages with, which is particularly important for the client library developers, who need to know what features of the RMW layer will be available for use by client libraries.\\nUpgrade dependency packages\\nPackages depended on by ROS but not ROS software and not available in the platform package manager (such as aptitude for Ubuntu), the so-called â\\x80\\x9cvendor packagesâ\\x80\\x9d, must be updated to the versions specified in REP-2000 (or an appropriate version, for those not listed in REP-2000). This is particularly important on Windows.\\nCreate a detailed release plan\\nPlanning for the final two months of the development process is performed. This produces a detailed test plan, timelines of when certain packages must be available, and so on. It enables the finding of dependencies between steps in the release process and finding people to perform each of those steps.\\nFreeze RMW\\nThe RMW implementation is now feature-frozen. In theory, it can now be exhaustively tested to ensure it is working correctly by release day.\\nAnnounce upcoming overall freeze\\nThe next freeze after freezing the RMW implementation is to freeze the distribution as a whole. This is the point at which the core ROS packages become feature-frozen, giving developers of non-core packages a stable target to test their packages against, and giving distribution testers something to test that wonâ\\x80\\x99t change right after theyâ\\x80\\x99ve tested it.\\nFreeze distribution\\nFrom this point on, no new features can be added to any of the core ROS packages. Only bug fixes for the (inevitable) bugs found during the intensive integration test phases of development can be incorporated into the codebase. This means that Rolling Ridley is effectively frozen, temperarily.\\nAnnounce upcoming branch\\nThe branching of the new ROS 2 distribution from Rolling Ridley is an important moment. It is worth preparing for.\\nAnnounce upcoming beta\\nWhen the distribution enters beta, it is ready for wider testing by the ROS community. This beta happens soon after the distribution is branched from Rolling Ridely.\\nBranch from Rolling Ridley\\nThe new ROS 2 distribution is created by making a new branch from Rolling Ridley. In effect, the new distribution is born at this point in time. Meanwhile, Rolling Ridley is free from the development process and can roll on into the future, once again receiving new features.\\nAdd distribution to CI\\nThe continuous integration system is updated to allow building using the new distributionâ\\x80\\x99s branches and core ROS packages. This means that package developers can run CI for their packages against the new distribution, rather than Rolling Ridley.\\nBegin building interim testing tarballs\\nThe elite team of testers who will put the new distribution through its paces need something to test without compiling ROS 2 from source constantly. The build farm is used to produce a set of tarballs containing the distribution at a point in time for the testers to test.\\nAdd distribution documentation\\nDetailed documentation about the distribution, such as the significant changes since the previous distribution, is added to the ROS 2 documentation site.\\nAnnounce beta\\nThe beta release of the distribution is made and the ROS community as a whole is invited to contribute to testing it (for those who arenâ\\x80\\x99t already doing so). At this point, the more testers the better, because the distribution needs to be put through as wide a range of scenarios as possible to find bugs before the release.\\nFinal release preparations\\nAs the new distribution enters is absolutely-completely-everything-frozen phase, the final preparations are made for the release. These include things like producing binary packages using the build farm so there will be something to release.\\nRelease\\nThe big day, which if all goes to plan coincides with World Turtle Day on May 23rd. The distributionâ\\x80\\x99s binary packages are made available in the release repository, and an announcement is made. Parties are held and the ROS 2 development team takes a well-earned break.\"},\n",

up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nConfiguring environment\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nGoal:\\nThis tutorial will show you how to prepare your ROS 2 environment.\\nTutorial level:\\nBeginner\\nTime:\\n5 minutes\\nContents\\nBackground\\nPrerequisites\\nTasks\\n1 Source the setup files\\n2 Add sourcing to your shell startup script\\n3 Check environment variables\\nSummary\\nNext steps\\nBackground\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 relies on the notion of combining workspaces using the shell environment.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWorkspaceâ\\x80\\x9d is a ROS term for the location on your system where youâ\\x80\\x99re developing with ROS 2.\\nThe core ROS 2 workspace is called the underlay.\\nSubsequent local workspaces are called overlays.\\nWhen developing with ROS 2, you will typically have several workspaces active concurrently.\\nCombining workspaces makes developing against different versions of ROS 2, or against different sets of packages, easier.\\nIt also allows the installation of several ROS 2 distributions (or â\\x80\\x9cdistrosâ\\x80\\x9d, e.g. Dashing and Eloquent) on the same computer and switching between them.\\nThis is accomplished by sourcing setup files every time you open a new shell, or by adding the source command to your shell startup script once.\\nWithout sourcing the setup files, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to access ROS 2 commands, or find or use ROS 2 packages.\\nIn other words, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to use ROS 2.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore starting these tutorials, install ROS 2 by following the instructions on the ROS 2\\nInstallation\\npage.\\nThe commands used in this tutorial assume you followed the binary packages installation guide for your operating system (Debian packages for Linux).\\nYou can still follow along if you built from source, but the path to your setup files will likely be different.\\nYou also wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to use the\\nsudo\\napt\\ninstall\\nros-<distro>-<package>\\ncommand (used frequently in the beginner level tutorials) if you install from source.\\nIf you are using Linux or macOS, but are not already familiar with the shell,\\nthis tutorial\\nwill help.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Source the setup files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou will need to run this command on every new shell you open to have access to the ROS 2 commands, like so:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n# Replace \".bash\" with your shell if you\\'re not using bash\\n# Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh\\nsource\\n/opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash\\n. ~/ros2_install/ros2-osx/setup.bash\\ncall C:\\\\dev\\\\ros2\\\\local_setup.bat\\nNote\\nThe exact command depends on where you installed ROS 2.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re having problems, ensure the file path leads to your installation.\\n2 Add sourcing to your shell startup script\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to have to source the setup file every time you open a new shell (skipping task 1), then you can add the command to your shell startup script:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\necho \"source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc\\nTo undo this, locate your systemâ\\x80\\x99s shell startup script and remove the appended source command.\\necho \"source ~/ros2_install/ros2-osx/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bash_profile\\nTo undo this, locate your systemâ\\x80\\x99s shell startup script and remove the appended source command.\\nOnly for PowerShell users, create a folder in â\\x80\\x98My Documentsâ\\x80\\x99 called â\\x80\\x98WindowsPowerShellâ\\x80\\x99.\\nWithin â\\x80\\x98WindowsPowerShellâ\\x80\\x99, create file â\\x80\\x98Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1â\\x80\\x99.\\nInside the file, paste:\\nC:\\\\dev\\\\ros2_galactic\\\\local_setup.ps1\\nPowerShell will request permission to run this script everytime a new shell is opened.\\nTo avoid that issue you can run:\\nUnblock-File C:\\\\dev\\\\ros2_galactic\\\\local_setup.ps1\\nTo undo this, remove the new â\\x80\\x98Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1â\\x80\\x99 file.\\n3 Check environment variables\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSourcing ROS 2 setup files will set several environment variables necessary for operating ROS 2.\\nIf you ever have problems finding or using your ROS 2 packages, make sure that your environment is properly setup using the following command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nprintenv | grep -i ROS\\nprintenv | grep -i ROS\\nset | findstr -i ROS\\nCheck that variables like\\nROS_DISTRO\\nand\\nROS_VERSION\\nare set.\\nROS_VERSION\\n=\\n2\\nROS_PYTHON_VERSION\\n=\\n3\\nROS_DISTRO\\n=\\ngalactic\\nIf the environment variables are not set correctly, return to the ROS 2 package installation section of the installation guide you followed.\\nIf you need more specific help (because environment setup files can come from different places), you can\\nget answers\\nfrom the community.\\n3.1 The\\nROS_DOMAIN_ID\\nvariable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSee the\\ndomain ID\\narticle for details on ROS domain IDs.\\nOnce you have determined a unique integer for your group of ROS 2 agents, you can set the environment variable with the following command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>\\nTo maintain this setting between shell sessions, you can add the command to your shell startup script:\\necho \"export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>\" >> ~/.bashrc\\nexport ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>\\nTo maintain this setting between shell sessions, you can add the command to your shell startup script:\\necho \"export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>\" >> ~/.bash_profile\\nset ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>\\nIf you want to make this permanant between shell sessions, also run:\\nsetx ROS_DOMAIN_ID <your_domain_id>\\n3.2 The\\nROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY\\nvariable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBy default, ROS 2 communication is not limited to localhost.\\nROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY\\nenvironment variable allows you to limit ROS 2 communication to localhost only.\\nThis means your ROS 2 system, and its topics, services, and actions will not be visible to other computers on the local network.\\nUsing\\nROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY\\nis helpful in certain settings, such as classrooms, where multiple robots may publish to the same topic causing strange behaviors.\\nYou can set the environment variable with the following command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1\\nTo maintain this setting between shell sessions, you can add the command to your shell startup script:\\necho \"export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1\" >> ~/.bashrc\\nexport ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1\\nTo maintain this setting between shell sessions, you can add the command to your shell startup script:\\necho \"export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1\" >> ~/.bash_profile\\nset ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1\\nIf you want to make this permanent between shell sessions, also run:\\nsetx ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY 1\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS 2 development environment needs to be correctly configured before use.\\nThis can be done in two ways: either sourcing the setup files in every new shell you open, or adding the source command to your startup script.\\nIf you ever face any problems locating or using packages with ROS 2, the first thing you should do is check your environment variables and ensure they are set to the version and distro you intended.\\nNext steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you have a working ROS 2 installation and you know how to source its setup files, you can start learning the ins and outs of ROS 2 with the\\nturtlesim tool\\n.'},\n",

for now, you will simply set up the tools and get a feel for them.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe previous tutorial,\\nConfiguring environment\\n, will show you how to set up your environment.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Install turtlesim\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs always, start by sourcing your setup files in a new terminal, as described in the\\nprevious tutorial\\n.\\nInstall the turtlesim package for your ROS 2 distro:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install ros-galactic-turtlesim\\nAs long as the archive you installed ROS 2 from contains the\\nros_tutorials\\nrepository, you should already have turtlesim installed.\\nAs long as the archive you installed ROS 2 from contains the\\nros_tutorials\\nrepository, you should already have turtlesim installed.\\nCheck that the package installed:\\nros2 pkg executables turtlesim\\nThe above command should return a list of turtlesimâ\\x80\\x99s executables:\\nturtlesim draw_square\\nturtlesim mimic\\nturtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nturtlesim turtlesim_node\\n2 Start turtlesim\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo start turtlesim, enter the following command in your terminal:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nThe simulator window should appear, with a random turtle in the center.\\nIn the terminal under the command, you will see messages from the node:\\n[INFO] [turtlesim]: Starting turtlesim with node name /turtlesim\\n[INFO] [turtlesim]: Spawning turtle [turtle1] at x=[5.544445], y=[5.544445], theta=[0.000000]\\nHere you can see your default turtleâ\\x80\\x99s name is\\nturtle1\\n, and the default coordinates where it spawns.\\n3 Use turtlesim\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen a new terminal and source ROS 2 again.\\nNow you will run a new node to control the turtle in the first node:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nAt this point you should have three windows open: a terminal running\\nturtlesim_node\\n, a terminal running\\nturtle_teleop_key\\nand the turtlesim window.\\nArrange these windows so that you can see the turtlesim window, but also have the terminal running\\nturtle_teleop_key\\nactive so that you can control the turtle in turtlesim.\\nUse the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the turtle.\\nIt will move around the screen, using its attached â\\x80\\x9cpenâ\\x80\\x9d to draw the path it followed so far.\\nNote\\nPressing an arrow key will only cause the turtle to move a short distance and then stop.\\nThis is because, realistically, you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want a robot to continue carrying on an instruction if, for example, the operator lost the connection to the robot.\\nYou can see the nodes and their associated services, topics, and actions using the\\nlist\\ncommand:\\nros2 node list\\nros2 topic list\\nros2 service list\\nros2 action list\\nYou will learn more about these concepts in the coming tutorials.\\nSince the goal of this tutorial is only to get a general overview of turtlesim, we will use rqt (a graphical user interface for ROS 2) to look at services a little closer.\\n4 Install rqt\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen a new terminal to install\\nrqt\\nand its plugins:\\nLinux (apt 2.0/Ubuntu 20.04 and newer)\\nLinux (apt 1.x/Ubuntu 18.04 and older)\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install ~nros-galactic-rqt*\\nsudo apt update\\nsudo apt install ros-galactic-rqt*\\nThe standard archive for installing ROS 2 on macOS contains\\nrqt\\nand its plugins, so you should already have\\nrqt\\ninstalled.\\nThe standard archive for installing ROS 2 on Windows contains\\nrqt\\nand its plugins, so you should already have\\nrqt\\ninstalled.\\nTo run rqt:\\nrqt\\n5 Use rqt\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAfter running rqt the first time, the window will be blank.\\nNo worries;

to as the â\\x80\\x9cROS (2) graphâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThe ROS graph is a network of ROS 2 elements processing data together at one time.\\nIt encompasses all executables and the connections between them if you were to map them all out and visualize them.\\n2 Nodes in ROS 2\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEach node in ROS should be responsible for a single, module purpose (e.g. one node for controlling wheel motors, one node for controlling a laser range-finder, etc).\\nEach node can send and receive data to other nodes via topics, services, actions, or parameters.\\nA full robotic system is comprised of many nodes working in concert.\\nIn ROS 2, a single executable (C++ program, Python program, etc.) can contain one or more nodes.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nprevious tutorial\\nshows you how to

command\\nros2\\nrun\\nlaunches an executable from a package.\\nros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>\\nTo run turtlesim, open a new terminal, and enter the following command:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nThe turtlesim window will open, as you saw in the\\nprevious tutorial\\n.\\nHere, the package name is\\nturtlesim\\nand the executable name is\\nturtlesim_node\\n.\\nWe still donâ\\x80\\x99t know the node name, however.\\nYou can find node names by using\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\n2 ros2 node list\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\nwill show you the names of all running nodes.\\nThis is especially useful when you want to interact with a node, or when you have a system running many nodes and need to keep track of them.\\nOpen a new terminal while turtlesim is still running in the other one, and enter the following command:\\nros2 node list\\nThe terminal will return the node name:\\n/turtlesim\\nOpen another new terminal and start the teleop node with the command:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nHere, we are searching the\\nturtlesim\\npackage again, this time for the executable named\\nturtle_teleop_key\\n.\\nReturn to the terminal where you ran\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\nand run it again.\\nYou will now see the names of two active nodes:\\n/turtlesim\\n/teleop_turtle\\n2.1 Remapping\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRemapping\\nallows you to reassign default node properties, like node name, topic names, service names, etc., to custom values.\\nIn the last tutorial, you used remapping on\\nturtle_teleop_key\\nto change the default turtle being controlled.\\nNow, lets reassign the name of our\\n/turtlesim\\nnode.\\nIn a new terminal, run the following command:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args --remap __node:=my_turtle\\nSince youâ\\x80\\x99re calling\\nros2\\nrun\\non turtlesim again, another turtlesim window will open.\\nHowever, now if you return to the terminal where you ran\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\n, and run it again, you will see three node names:\\n/my_turtle\\n/turtlesim\\n/teleop_turtle\\n3 ros2 node info\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you know the names of your nodes, you can access more information about them with:\\nros2 node info <node_name>\\nTo examine your latest node,\\nmy_turtle\\n, run the following command:\\nros2 node info /my_turtle\\nros2\\nnode\\ninfo\\nreturns a list of subscribers, publishers, services, and actions (the ROS graph connections) that interact with that node.\\nThe output should look like this:\\n/my_turtle\\nSubscribers:\\n/parameter_events:

including the message types in the upcoming tutorials.\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA node is a fundamental ROS 2 element that serves a single, modular purpose in a robotics system.\\nIn this tutorial, you utilized nodes created from the\\nturtlesim\\npackage by running the executables\\nturtlesim_node\\nand\\nturtle_teleop_key\\n.\\nYou learned how to use\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\nto discover active

ways in which data is moved between nodes and therefore between different parts of the system.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nprevious tutorial\\nprovides some useful background information on

starting up turtlesim.\\nOpen a new terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nOpen another terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nRecall from the\\nprevious tutorial\\nthat the names of these nodes are\\n/turtlesim\\nand\\n/teleop_turtle\\nby default.\\n2 rqt_graph\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThroughout this tutorial, we will use\\nrqt_graph\\nto visualize the changing nodes and topics, as well as the connections between them.\\nThe\\nturtlesim tutorial\\ntells you how to install rqt and all its plugins, including\\nrqt_graph\\n.\\nTo run rqt_graph, open a new terminal and enter the command:\\nrqt_graph\\nYou can also open rqt_graph by opening\\nrqt\\nand selecting\\nPlugins\\n>\\nIntrospection\\n>\\nNode Graph\\n.\\nYou should see the above nodes and topic, as well as two actions around the periphery of the graph (letâ\\x80\\x99s ignore those for now).\\nIf you hover your mouse over the topic in the center, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see the color highlighting like in the image above.\\nThe graph is depicting how the\\n/turtlesim\\nnode and the\\n/teleop_turtle\\nnode are communicating with each other over a topic.\\nThe\\n/teleop_turtle\\nnode is publishing data (the keystrokes you enter to move the turtle around) to the\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\\ntopic, and the\\n/turtlesim\\nnode is subscribed to that topic to receive the data.\\nThe highlighting feature of rqt_graph is very helpful when examining more complex systems with many nodes and topics connected in many different ways.\\nrqt_graph is a graphical introspection tool.\\nNow weâ\\x80\\x99ll look at some command line tools for introspecting topics.\\n3 ros2 topic list\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRunning the\\nros2\\ntopic\\nlist\\ncommand in a new terminal will return a list of all the topics currently active in the system:\\n/parameter_events\\n/rosout\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\\n/turtle1/color_sensor\\n/turtle1/pose\\nros2\\ntopic\\nlist\\n-t\\nwill return the same list of topics, this time with the topic type appended in brackets:\\n/parameter_events [rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent]\\n/rosout [rcl_interfaces/msg/Log]\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel [geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]\\n/turtle1/color_sensor [turtlesim/msg/Color]\\n/turtle1/pose [turtlesim/msg/Pose]\\nThese attributes, particularly the type, are how nodes know theyâ\\x80\\x99re talking about the same information as it moves over topics.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re wondering where all these topics are in rqt_graph, you can uncheck all the boxes under\\nHide:\\nFor now, though, leave those options checked to avoid confusion.\\n4 ros2 topic echo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo see the data being published on a topic, use:\\nros2 topic echo <topic_name>\\nSince we know that\\n/teleop_turtle\\npublishes data to\\n/turtlesim\\nover the\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\\ntopic, letâ\\x80\\x99s use\\necho\\nto introspect on that topic:\\nros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel\\nAt first, this command wonâ\\x80\\x99t return any data.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s because itâ\\x80\\x99s waiting for\\n/teleop_turtle\\nto publish something.\\nReturn to the terminal where\\nturtle_teleop_key\\nis running and use the arrows to move the turtle around.\\nWatch the terminal where your\\necho\\nis running at the same time, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll see position data being published for every movement you make:\\nlinear:\\nx: 2.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\nangular:\\nx: 0.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\n---\\nNow return to rqt_graph and uncheck the\\nDebug\\nbox.\\n/_ros2cli_26646\\nis the node created by the\\necho\\nwe just ran (the number might be different).\\nNow you can see that the publisher is publishing data over the\\ncmd_vel\\ntopic, and two subscribers are subscribed.\\n5 ros2 topic info\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTopics donâ\\x80\\x99t have to only be point-to-point communication; it can be one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.\\nAnother way to look at this is running:\\nros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel\\nWhich will return:\\nType: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nPublisher count: 1\\nSubscription count: 2\\n6 ros2 interface show\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNodes send data over topics using messages.\\nPublishers and subscribers must send and receive the same type of message to communicate.\\nThe topic types we saw earlier after running\\nros2\\ntopic\\nlist\\n-t\\nlet us know what message type is used on each topic.\\nRecall that the\\ncmd_vel\\ntopic has the type:\\ngeometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nThis means that in the package\\ngeometry_msgs\\nthere is a\\nmsg\\ncalled\\nTwist\\n.\\nNow we can run\\nros2\\ninterface\\nshow\\n<msg\\ntype>\\non this type to learn its details, specifically, what structure of data the message expects.\\nros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nFor the message type from above it yields:\\n#\\nThis\\nexpresses\\nvelocity\\nin\\nfree\\nspace\\nbroken\\ninto\\nits\\nlinear\\nand\\nangular\\nparts.\\nVector3  linear\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nVector3  angular\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nThis tells you that the\\n/turtlesim\\nnode is expecting a message with two vectors,\\nlinear\\nand\\nangular\\n, of three elements each.\\nIf you recall the data we saw\\n/teleop_turtle\\npassing to\\n/turtlesim\\nwith the\\necho\\ncommand, itâ\\x80\\x99s in the same structure:\\nlinear:\\nx: 2.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\nangular:\\nx: 0.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\n---\\n7 ros2 topic pub\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you have the message structure, you can publish data onto a topic directly from the command line using:\\nros2 topic pub <topic_name> <msg_type> \\'<args>\\'\\nThe\\n\\'<args>\\'\\nargument is the actual data youâ\\x80\\x99ll pass to the topic, in the structure you just discovered in the previous section.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s important to note that this argument needs to be input in YAML syntax.\\nInput the full command like so:\\nros2 topic pub --once

model, versus topicsâ\\x80\\x99 publisher-subscriber model.\\nWhile topics allow nodes to subscribe to data streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they are specifically called by a client.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSome concepts mentioned in this tutorial, like\\nNodes\\nand\\nTopics\\n, were covered in previous tutorials in the series.\\nYou will need the\\nturtlesim package\\n.\\nAs always, donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to source ROS 2 in\\nevery new terminal you open\\n.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Setup\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nStart up the two turtlesim nodes,\\n/turtlesim\\nand\\n/teleop_turtle\\n.\\nOpen a new terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nOpen another terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\n2 ros2 service list\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRunning the\\nros2\\nservice\\nlist\\ncommand in a new terminal will return a list of all the services currently active in the system:\\n/clear\\n/kill\\n/reset\\n/spawn\\n/teleop_turtle/describe_parameters\\n/teleop_turtle/get_parameter_types\\n/teleop_turtle/get_parameters\\n/teleop_turtle/list_parameters\\n/teleop_turtle/set_parameters\\n/teleop_turtle/set_parameters_atomically\\n/turtle1/set_pen\\n/turtle1/teleport_absolute\\n/turtle1/teleport_relative\\n/turtlesim/describe_parameters\\n/turtlesim/get_parameter_types\\n/turtlesim/get_parameters\\n/turtlesim/list_parameters\\n/turtlesim/set_parameters\\n/turtlesim/set_parameters_atomically\\nYou will see that both nodes have the same six services with\\nparameters\\nin their names.\\nNearly every node in ROS 2 has these infrastructure services that parameters are built off of.\\nThere will be more about parameters in the next tutorial.\\nIn this tutorial, the parameter services will be omitted from discussion.\\nFor now, letâ\\x80\\x99s focus on the turtlesim-specific services,\\n/clear\\n,\\n/kill\\n,\\n/reset\\n,\\n/spawn\\n,\\n/turtle1/set_pen\\n,\\n/turtle1/teleport_absolute\\n, and\\n/turtle1/teleport_relative\\n.\\nYou may recall interacting with some of these services using rqt in the\\nUse turtlesim and rqt\\ntutorial.\\n3 ros2 service type\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nServices have types that describe how the request and response data of a service is structured.\\nService types are defined similarly to topic types, except service types have two parts: one message for the request and another for the response.\\nTo find out the type of a service, use the command:\\nros2 service type <service_name>\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at turtlesimâ\\x80\\x99s\\n/clear\\nservice.\\nIn a new terminal, enter the command:\\nros2 service type /clear\\nWhich should return:\\nstd_srvs/srv/Empty\\nThe\\nEmpty\\ntype means the service call sends no data when making a request and receives no data when receiving a response.\\n3.1 ros2 service list -t\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo see the types of all the active services at the same time, you can append the\\n--show-types\\noption, abbreviated as\\n-t\\n, to the\\nlist\\ncommand:\\nros2 service list -t\\nWhich will return:\\n/clear [std_srvs/srv/Empty]\\n/kill [turtlesim/srv/Kill]\\n/reset [std_srvs/srv/Empty]\\n/spawn [turtlesim/srv/Spawn]\\n...\\n/turtle1/set_pen [turtlesim/srv/SetPen]\\n/turtle1/teleport_absolute [turtlesim/srv/TeleportAbsolute]\\n/turtle1/teleport_relative [turtlesim/srv/TeleportRelative]\\n...\\n4 ros2 service find\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf you want to find all the services of a specific type, you can use the command:\\nros2 service find <type_name>\\nFor example, you can find all the\\nEmpty\\ntyped services like this:\\nros2 service find std_srvs/srv/Empty\\nWhich will return:\\n/clear\\n/reset\\n5 ros2 interface show\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can call services from the command line, but first you need to know the structure of the input arguments.\\nros2 interface show <type_name>\\nTo run this command on the\\n/clear\\nserviceâ\\x80\\x99s type,\\nEmpty\\n:\\nros2 interface show std_srvs/srv/Empty\\nWhich will return:\\n---\\nThe\\n---\\nseparates the request structure (above) from the response structure (below).\\nBut, as you learned earlier, the\\nEmpty\\ntype doesnâ\\x80\\x99t send or receive any data.\\nSo, naturally, its structure is blank.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s introspect a service with a type that sends and receives data, like\\n/spawn\\n.\\nFrom the results of\\nros2\\nservice\\nlist\\n-t\\n, we know\\n/spawn\\nâ\\x80\\x99s type is\\nturtlesim/srv/Spawn\\n.\\nTo see the arguments in a\\n/spawn\\ncall-and-request, run the command:\\nros2 interface show turtlesim/srv/Spawn\\nWhich will return:\\nfloat32 x\\nfloat32 y\\nfloat32 theta\\nstring name # Optional.  A unique name will be created and returned if this is empty\\n---\\nstring name\\nThe information above the\\n---\\nline tells us the arguments needed to call\\n/spawn\\n.\\nx\\n,\\ny\\nand\\ntheta\\ndetermine the location of the spawned turtle, and\\nname\\nis clearly optional.\\nThe information below the line isnâ\\x80\\x99t something you need to know in this case, but it can help you understand the data type of the response you get from the call.\\n6 ros2 service call\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you know what a service type is, how to find a serviceâ\\x80\\x99s type, and how to find the structure of that typeâ\\x80\\x99s arguments, you can call a service using:\\nros2 service call <service_name> <service_type> <arguments>\\nThe\\n<arguments>\\npart is optional.\\nFor example, you know that\\nEmpty\\ntyped services donâ\\x80\\x99t have any arguments:\\nros2 service call /clear std_srvs/srv/Empty\\nThis command will clear the turtlesim window of any lines your turtle has drawn.\\nNow letâ\\x80\\x99s spawn a new turtle by calling\\n/spawn\\nand inputting arguments.\\nInput\\n<arguments>\\nin a service call from the command-line need to be in YAML syntax.\\nEnter the command:\\nros2 service call /spawn turtlesim/srv/Spawn \"{x: 2, y: 2, theta: 0.2, name: \\'\\'}\"\\nYou will get this method-style view of whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening, and then the service response:\\nrequester: making request: turtlesim.srv.Spawn_Request(x=2.0, y=2.0, theta=0.2, name=\\'\\')\\nresponse:\\nturtlesim.srv.Spawn_Response(name=\\'turtle2\\')\\nYour turtlesim window will update with the newly spawned turtle right away:\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNodes can communicate using services in ROS 2.\\nUnlike a topic - a one way communication pattern where a node publishes information that can be consumed by one or more subscribers - a service is a request/response pattern where a client makes a request to a node providing the service and the service processes the request and generates a response.\\nYou generally donâ\\x80\\x99t want to use a service for continuous calls; topics or even actions would be better suited.\\nIn this tutorial you used command line tools to identify, elaborate on, and call services.\\nNext steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the next tutorial,\\nUnderstanding parameters\\n, you will learn about configuring node settings.\\nRelated content\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nCheck out\\nthis tutorial\\n; itâ\\x80\\x99s an excellent realistic application of ROS services using a Robotis robot arm.'},\n",

type, run the command:\\nros2 action list -t\\nWhich will return:\\n/turtle1/rotate_absolute [turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute]\\nIn brackets to the right of each action name (in this case only\\n/turtle1/rotate_absolute\\n) is the action type,\\nturtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute\\n.\\nYou will need this when you want to execute an action from the command line or from code.\\n5 ros2 action info\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can further introspect the\\n/turtle1/rotate_absolute\\naction with the command:\\nros2 action info /turtle1/rotate_absolute\\nWhich will return\\nAction:

piece of information you will need before sending or executing an action goal yourself is the structure of the action type.\\nRecall that you identified\\n/turtle1/rotate_absolute\\nâ\\x80\\x99s type when running the command\\nros2\\naction\\nlist\\n-t\\n.\\nEnter the following command with the action type in your terminal:\\nros2 interface show turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute\\nWhich will return:\\n#\\nThe\\ndesired\\nheading\\nin\\nradians\\nfloat32 theta\\n---\\n#\\nThe\\nangular\\ndisplacement\\nin\\nradians\\nto\\nthe\\nstarting\\nposition\\nfloat32

request.\\nThe next section is the structure of the result.\\nThe last section is the structure of the feedback.\\n7 ros2 action send_goal\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow letâ\\x80\\x99s send an action goal from the command line with the following syntax:\\nros2 action send_goal <action_name> <action_type> <values>\\n<values>\\nneed to be in YAML format.\\nKeep an eye on the turtlesim window, and enter the following command into your terminal:\\nros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute \"{theta: 1.57}\"\\nYou should see the turtle rotating, as well as the following message in your terminal:\\nWaiting for an action server to become available...\\nSending goal:\\ntheta: 1.57\\nGoal accepted with ID: f8db8f44410849eaa93d3feb747dd444\\nResult:\\ndelta:

displacement to the starting position.\\nTo see the feedback of this goal, add\\n--feedback\\nto the\\nros2\\naction\\nsend_goal\\ncommand:\\nros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute

provide regular feedback, and are cancelable.\\nA robot system would likely use actions for navigation.\\nAn action goal could tell a robot to travel to a position.\\nWhile the robot navigates to the position, it can send updates along the way (i.e. feedback), and then a final result message once itâ\\x80\\x99s reached its destination.\\nTurtlesim has an action server that action clients can send goals to for rotating turtles.\\nIn this tutorial, you introspected that action,\\n/turtle1/rotate_absolute\\n, to get a better idea of what actions are and how they work.\\nNext steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow youâ\\x80\\x99ve covered all of the core ROS 2 concepts.\\nThe last few tutorials in the â\\x80\\x9cUsersâ\\x80\\x9d set will introduce you to some tools and techniques that

an underlay\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is important that we have sourced the environment for an existing ROS 2 installation that will provide our workspace with the necessary build dependencies for the example packages.\\nThis is achieved by sourcing the setup script provided by a binary installation or a source installation, ie. another colcon workspace (see\\nInstallation\\n).\\nWe call this environment an\\nunderlay\\n.\\nOur workspace,\\nros2_ws\\n, will be an\\noverlay\\non top of the existing ROS 2 installation.\\nIn general, it is recommended to use an overlay when you plan to iterate on a small number of packages, rather than putting all of your packages into the same workspace.\\nBuild the workspace\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAttention\\nTo build packages on Windows you need to be in a Visual Studio environment, see\\nBuilding the ROS 2 Code\\nfor more details.\\nIn the root of the workspace, run\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n.\\nSince build types such as\\nament_cmake\\ndo not support the concept of the\\ndevel\\nspace and require the package to be installed, colcon supports the option\\n--symlink-install\\n.\\nThis allows the installed files to be changed by changing the files in the\\nsource\\nspace (e.g. Python files or other not compiled resourced) for faster iteration.\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\ncolcon build --symlink-install\\ncolcon build --symlink-install\\ncolcon build --symlink-install --merge-install\\nWindows doesnâ\\x80\\x99t allow long paths, so\\nmerge-install\\nwill combine all the paths into the\\ninstall\\ndirectory.\\nAfter the build is finished, we should see the\\nbuild\\n,\\ninstall\\n,

a\\nx64\\nNative\\nTools\\nCommand\\nPrompt\\nfor\\nVS\\n2019\\nfor executing the following command, as we are going to build a workspace.\\ncolcon test --merge-install\\nYou also need to specify\\n--merge-install\\nhere since we used it for building above.\\nSource the environment\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen colcon has completed building successfully, the output will be in the\\ninstall\\ndirectory.\\nBefore you can use any of the installed executables or libraries, you will need to add them to your path and library paths.\\ncolcon will have generated bash/bat files in the\\ninstall\\ndirectory to help setup the environment.\\nThese files will add all of the required elements to your path and library paths as well as provide any bash or shell commands exported by packages.\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n.\\ninstall/setup.bash\\n.\\ninstall/setup.bash\\ncall\\ninstall\\n\\\\s\\netup.bat\\nOr with Powershell:\\ninstall\\n\\\\s\\netup.ps1\\nTry a demo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWith the environment sourced we can run executables built by colcon.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s run a subscriber node from the examples:\\nros2\\nrun\\nexamples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber\\nsubscriber_member_function\\nIn another terminal, letâ\\x80\\x99s run a publisher node (donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to source the setup script):\\nros2\\nrun\\nexamples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher\\npublisher_member_function\\nYou should see messages from the publisher and subscriber with numbers incrementing.\\nCreate your own package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\ncolcon uses the\\npackage.xml\\nspecification defined in\\nREP 149\\n(\\nformat 2\\nis also supported).\\ncolcon supports multiple build types.\\nThe recommended build types are\\nament_cmake\\nand\\nament_python\\n.\\nAlso supported are pure\\ncmake\\npackages.\\nAn example of an\\nament_python\\nbuild is the\\nament_index_python package\\n, where the setup.py is the primary entry point for building.\\nA package such as\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\nuses the\\nament_cmake\\nbuild type, and uses CMake as the build tool.\\nFor convenience, you can use the tool\\nros2\\npkg\\ncreate\\nto create a new package based on a template.\\nNote\\nFor\\ncatkin\\nusers, this is the equivalent of\\ncatkin_create_package\\n.\\nSetup\\ncolcon_cd\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe command\\ncolcon_cd\\nallows you to quickly change the current working directory of your shell to the directory of a package.\\nAs an example\\ncolcon_cd\\nsome_ros_package\\nwould quickly bring you

The\\nros_tutorials\\nrepository contains the\\nturtlesim\\npackage, which weâ\\x80\\x99ll use in the rest of this tutorial.  The other packages in this repository are not built because they contain a\\nCOLCON_IGNORE\\nfile.\\nNow you have populated your workspace with a sample package, but it isnâ\\x80\\x99t a fully-functional workspace yet.\\nYou need to resolve dependencies and build the workspace first.\\n4 Resolve dependencies\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore building the workspace, you need to resolve package dependencies.\\nYou may have all the dependencies already, but best practice is to check for dependencies every time you clone.\\nYou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want a build to fail after a long wait because of missing dependencies.\\nFrom the root of your workspace (\\nros2_ws\\n), run the following command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n# cd if you\\'re still in the ``src`` directory with the ``ros_tutorials`` clone\\ncd\\n..\\nrosdep\\ninstall\\n-i\\n--from-path\\nsrc\\n--rosdistro\\ngalactic\\n-y\\nrosdep only runs on Linux, so you can skip ahead to section â\\x80\\x9c5 Build the workspace with colconâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nrosdep only runs on Linux, so you can skip ahead to section â\\x80\\x9c5 Build the workspace with colconâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nIf you installed ROS 2 on Linux from source or the â\\x80\\x9cfatâ\\x80\\x9d archive, you will need to use the rosdep command from their installation instructions.\\nHere are the\\nfrom-source rosdep section\\nand the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfatâ\\x80\\x9d archive rosdep section\\n.\\nIf you already have all your dependencies, the console will return:\\n#\\nAll\\nrequired\\nrosdeps\\ninstalled\\nsuccessfully\\nPackages declare their dependencies in the package.xml file (you will learn more about packages in the next tutorial).\\nThis command walks through those declarations and installs the ones that are missing.\\nYou can learn more about\\nrosdep\\nin another tutorial (coming soon).\\n5 Build the workspace with colcon\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFrom the root of your workspace (\\nros2_ws\\n), you can now build your packages using the command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\ncolcon build\\ncolcon build\\ncolcon build --merge-install\\nWindows doesnâ\\x80\\x99t allow long paths, so\\nmerge-install\\nwill combine all the paths into the\\ninstall\\ndirectory.\\nThe console will return the following message:\\nStarting >>> turtlesim\\nFinished <<< turtlesim [5.49s]\\nSummary: 1 package finished [5.58s]\\nNote\\nOther useful arguments for\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n:\\n--packages-up-to\\nbuilds the package you want, plus all its dependencies, but not the whole workspace (saves time)\\n--symlink-install\\nsaves you from having to rebuild every time you tweak python scripts\\n--event-handlers\\nconsole_direct+\\nshows console output while building (can otherwise be found in the\\nlog\\ndirectory)\\nOnce the build is finished, enter\\nls\\nin the workspace root (\\n~/ros2_ws\\n) and you will see that colcon has created new directories:\\nbuild  install  log  src\\nThe\\ninstall\\ndirectory is where your workspaceâ\\x80\\x99s setup files are, which you can use to source your overlay.\\n6 Source the overlay\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore sourcing the overlay, it is very important that you open a new terminal, separate from the one where you built the workspace.\\nSourcing an overlay in the same terminal where you built, or likewise building where an overlay is sourced, may create complex issues.\\nIn the new terminal, source your main ROS 2 environment as the â\\x80\\x9cunderlayâ\\x80\\x9d, so you can build the overlay â\\x80\\x9con top ofâ\\x80\\x9d it:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nsource /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash\\n. ~/ros2_install/ros2-osx/setup.bash\\nIn this case you can use a normal command prompt, as we are not going to build any workspace in this terminal.\\ncall C:\\\\dev\\\\ros2\\\\local_setup.bat\\nGo into the root of your workspace:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\ncd ~/ros2_ws\\ncd ~/ros2_ws\\ncd \\\\ros2_ws\\nIn the root, source your overlay:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\ncall install/setup.bat\\nNote\\nSourcing the\\nlocal_setup\\nof the overlay will only add the packages available in the overlay to your environment.\\nsetup\\nsources the overlay as well as the underlay it was created in, allowing you to utilize both workspaces.\\nSo, sourcing your main ROS 2 installationâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsetup\\nand then the\\nros2_ws\\noverlayâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlocal_setup\\n, like you just did,\\nis the same as just sourcing\\nros2_ws\\nâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsetup\\n, because that includes the environment of the underlay it was created in.\\nNow you can run the\\nturtlesim\\npackage from the overlay:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nBut how can you tell that this is the overlay turtlesim running, and not your main installationâ\\x80\\x99s turtlesim?\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s modify turtlesim in the overlay so you can see the effects:\\nYou can modify and rebuild packages in the overlay separately from the underlay.\\nThe overlay takes precedence over the underlay.\\n7 Modify the overlay\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can modify\\nturtlesim\\nin your overlay by editing the title bar on the turtlesim window.\\nTo do this, locate the\\nturtle_frame.cpp\\nfile in\\n~/ros2_ws/src/ros_tutorials/turtlesim/src\\n.\\nOpen\\nturtle_frame.cpp\\nwith your preferred text editor.\\nOn line 52 you will see the function\\nsetWindowTitle(\"TurtleSim\");\\n.\\nChange the value\\nâ\\x80\\x9dTurtleSimâ\\x80\\x9d\\nto\\nâ\\x80\\x9dMyTurtleSimâ\\x80\\x9d\\n, and save the file.\\nReturn to first terminal where you ran\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\nearlier and run it again.\\nReturn to the second terminal (where the overlay is sourced) and run turtlesim again:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nYou will see the title bar on the turtlesim window now says â\\x80\\x9cMyTurtleSimâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nEven though your main ROS 2 environment was sourced in this terminal earlier, the overlay of your\\nros2_ws\\nenvironment takes precedence over the contents of the underlay.\\nTo see that your underlay is still intact, open a brand new terminal and source only your ROS 2 installation.\\nRun turtlesim again:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nYou can see that modifications in the overlay did not actually affect anything in the underlay.\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this tutorial, you sourced your main ROS 2 distro install as your underlay, and created an overlay by cloning and building packages in a new workspace.\\nThe overlay gets prepended to the path, and takes precedence over the underlay, as you saw with your modified turtlesim.\\nUsing overlays is recommended for working on a small number of packages, so you donâ\\x80\\x99t have to put everything in the same workspace and rebuild a huge workspace on every iteration.\\nNext steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you understand the details behind creating, building and sourcing your own workspace, you can learn how to\\ncreate your own packages\\n.'},\n",

mightâ\\x80\\x99ve noticed that running\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\nalso built the\\nturtlesim\\npackage.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s fine when you only have a few packages in your workspace, but when there are many packages,\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\ncan take a long time.\\nTo build only the\\nmy_package\\npackage next time, you can run:\\ncolcon build --packages-select my_package\\n3 Source the setup file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo use your new package and executable, first open a new terminal and source your main ROS 2 installation.\\nThen, from inside the\\nros2_ws\\ndirectory, run the following command to source your workspace:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\ncall install/local_setup.bat\\nNow that your workspace has been added to your path, you will be able to use your new packageâ\\x80\\x99s executables.\\n4 Use the package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo run the executable you created using the\\n--node-name\\nargument during package creation, enter the command:\\nros2 run my_package my_node\\nWhich will return a message to your terminal:\\nCMake\\nPython\\nhello world my_package package\\nHi from my_package.\\n5 Examine package contents\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside\\nros2_ws/src/my_package\\n, you will see the files and folders that\\nros2\\npkg\\ncreate\\nautomatically generated:\\nCMake\\nPython\\nCMakeLists.txt  include

test\\nmy_node.py\\nis inside the\\nmy_package\\ndirectory.\\nThis is where all your custom Python nodes will go in the future.\\n6 Customize package.xml\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou may have noticed in the return message after creating your package that the fields\\ndescription\\nand\\nlicense\\ncontain\\nTODO\\nnotes.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s because the package description and license declaration are not automatically set, but are required if you ever want to release your package.\\nThe\\nmaintainer\\nfield may also need to be filled in.\\nFrom\\nros2_ws/src/my_package\\n, open\\npackage.xml\\nusing

install/setup.bat\\nNow run the talker node:\\nros2 run cpp_pubsub talker\\nThe terminal should start publishing info messages every 0.5 seconds, like so:\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 0\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 1\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 2\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 3\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 4\"\\nOpen another terminal, source the setup files from inside\\nros2_ws\\nagain, and then start the listener node:\\nros2 run cpp_pubsub listener\\nThe listener will start printing messages to the console, starting at whatever message count the publisher is on at that time, like so:\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: \"Hello World: 10\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: \"Hello World: 11\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: \"Hello World: 12\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber]: I heard: \"Hello World: 13\"\\n[INFO]

probably need to define your own messages and services sometimes as well.\\nThis tutorial will introduce you to the simplest method of creating custom interface definitions.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou should have a\\nROS 2 workspace\\n.\\nThis tutorial also uses the packages created in the publisher/subscriber (\\nC++\\nand\\nPython\\n) and service/client  (\\nC++\\nand\\nPython\\n) tutorials to try out the new custom messages.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Create a new package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor this tutorial you will be creating custom\\n.msg\\nand\\n.srv\\nfiles in their own package, and then utilizing them in a separate package.\\nBoth packages should be in the same workspace.\\nSince we will use the pub/sub and service/client packages created in earlier tutorials, make sure you are in the same workspace as those packages (\\nros2_ws/src\\n), and then run the following command to create a new package:\\nros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake tutorial_interfaces\\ntutorial_interfaces\\nis the name of the new package.\\nNote that it is a CMake package; there currently isnâ\\x80\\x99t a way to generate

one line of code declaring its data structure:\\nint64 num\\nThis is a custom message that transfers a single 64-bit integer called\\nnum\\n.\\nAlso in the\\ntutorial_interfaces/msg\\ndirectory you just created, make a new file called\\nSphere.msg\\nwith the following content:\\ngeometry_msgs/Point center\\nfloat64 radius\\nThis custom message uses a message from another message package (\\ngeometry_msgs/Point\\nin this case).\\n2.2 srv definition\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBack in the\\ntutorial_interfaces/srv\\ndirectory you just created, make a new file called\\nAddThreeInts.srv\\nwith the following request and response structure:\\nint64 a\\nint64 b\\nint64 c\\n---\\nint64 sum\\nThis is your custom service that requests three integers named\\na\\n,\\nb\\n, and\\nc\\n, and responds with an integer called\\nsum\\n.\\n3\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo convert the interfaces you defined into language-specific code (like C++ and Python) so that they can be used in those languages, add the following lines to\\nCMakeLists.txt\\n:\\nfind_package\\n(\\ngeometry_msgs\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nfind_package\\n(\\nrosidl_default_generators\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n(\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\n\"msg/Num.msg\"\\n\"msg/Sphere.msg\"\\n\"srv/AddThreeInts.srv\"\\nDEPENDENCIES\\ngeometry_msgs\\n#

(see\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/rosidl/issues/441#issuecomment-591025515\\n).\\n4\\npackage.xml\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBecause the interfaces rely on\\nrosidl_default_generators\\nfor generating language-specific code, you need to declare a dependency on it.\\nThe\\n<exec_depend>\\ntag is used to specify runtime or execution-stage dependencies and the\\nrosidl_interface_packages\\nis the name of the dependency group to which the package belongs, declared using the\\n<member_of_group>\\ntag.\\nAdd the following lines

Build the\\ntutorial_interfaces\\npackage\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that all the parts of your custom interfaces package are in place, you can build the package.\\nIn the root of your workspace (\\n~/ros2_ws\\n), run the following command:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\ncolcon build --packages-select tutorial_interfaces\\ncolcon build --packages-select tutorial_interfaces\\ncolcon build

up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nImplementing custom interfaces\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nGoal:\\nLearn more ways to implement custom interfaces in ROS 2\\nTutorial level:\\nBeginner\\nTime:\\n15 minutes\\nContents\\nBackground\\nPrerequisites\\nTasks\\n1 Create a package\\n2 Create a msg file\\n3 Use an interface from the same package\\n4 Try it out\\n5 (Extra) Use an existing interface definition\\nSummary\\nNext steps\\nRelated content\\nBackground\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn a\\nprevious tutorial\\n, you learned how to create custom msg and srv interfaces.\\nWhile best practice is to declare interfaces in dedicated interface packages, sometimes it can be convenient to declare, create and use an interface all in one package.\\nRecall that interfaces can currently only be defined in CMake packages.\\nIt is possible, however, to have Python libraries and nodes in CMake packages (using\\nament_cmake_python\\n), so you could define interfaces and Python nodes together in one package.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ll use a CMake package and C++ nodes here for the sake of simplicity.\\nThis tutorial will focus on the msg interface type, but the steps here are applicable to all interface types.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe assume youâ\\x80\\x99ve reviewed the basics in the\\nCreating custom msg and srv files\\ntutorial before working through this one.\\nYou should have\\nROS 2 installed\\n, a\\nworkspace\\n, and an understanding of\\ncreating packages\\n.\\nAs always, donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to\\nsource ROS 2\\nin every new terminal you open.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Create a package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn your workspace\\nsrc\\ndirectory, create a package\\nmore_interfaces\\nand make a folder within it for msg files:\\nros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake more_interfaces\\nmkdir more_interfaces/msg\\n2 Create a msg file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside\\nmore_interfaces/msg\\n, create a new file\\nAddressBook.msg\\nPaste the following code to create a message meant to carry information about an individual:\\nbool\\nFEMALE\\n=\\ntrue\\nbool\\nMALE\\n=\\nfalse\\nstring\\nfirst_name\\nstring\\nlast_name\\nbool\\ngender\\nuint8\\nage\\nstring\\naddress\\nThis message is composed of 5 fields:\\nfirst_name: of type string\\nlast_name: of type string\\ngender: of type bool, that can be either MALE or FEMALE\\nage: of type uint8\\naddress: of type string\\nNotice that itâ\\x80\\x99s possible to set default values for fields within the message definition.\\nSee\\nAbout ROS 2 interfaces\\nfor more ways you can customize interfaces.\\nNext, we need to make sure that the msg file is turned into source code for C++, Python, and other languages.\\n2.1 Build a msg file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen\\npackage.xml\\n, and add the following lines:\\n<buildtool_depend>\\nrosidl_default_generators\\n</buildtool_depend>\\n<exec_depend>\\nrosidl_default_runtime\\n</exec_depend>\\n<member_of_group>\\nrosidl_interface_packages\\n</member_of_group>\\nNote that at build time, we need\\nrosidl_default_generators\\n, while at runtime, we only need\\nrosidl_default_runtime\\n.\\nOpen\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nand add the following lines:\\nFind the package that generates message code from msg/srv files:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nrosidl_default_generators\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nDeclare the list of messages you want to generate:\\nset\\n(\\nmsg_files\\n\"msg/AddressBook.msg\"\\n)\\nBy adding the .msg files manually, we make sure that CMake knows when it has to reconfigure the project after you add other .msg files.\\nGenerate the messages:\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n(\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\n${\\nmsg_files\\n}\\n)\\nAlso make sure you export the message runtime

Link against the interface\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn order to use the messages generated in the same package we need to use the following CMake code:\\nrosidl_target_interfaces\\n(\\npublish_address_book\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\n\"rosidl_typesupport_cpp\"\\n)\\nThis finds the relevant generated C++ code from\\nAddressBook.msg\\nand allows your target to link against it.\\nYou may have noticed that this step was not necessary when the interfaces being used were from a package that was built separately.\\nThis CMake code is only required when you want to use interfaces in the same package as the one in which they are used.\\n4 Try it out\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nReturn to the root of the workspace to build the package:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\ncd ~/ros2_ws\\ncolcon build --packages-up-to more_interfaces\\ncd ~/ros2_ws\\ncolcon build --packages-up-to more_interfaces\\ncd /ros2_ws\\ncolcon build --merge-install --packages-up-to more_interfaces\\nThen source the workspace and run the publisher:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\nros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book\\n. install/local_setup.bash\\nros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book\\ncall install/local_setup.bat\\nros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book\\nOr using Powershell:\\ninstall/local_setup.ps1\\nros2 run more_interfaces publish_address_book\\nYou should see the publisher relaying the msg you defined, including the values you set in\\npublish_address_book.cpp\\n.\\nTo confirm the message is being published on the\\naddress_book\\ntopic, open another terminal, source the workspace, and call\\ntopic\\necho\\n:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\n. install/setup.bash\\nros2 topic echo /address_book\\n. install/setup.bash\\nros2 topic echo /address_book\\ncall install/setup.bat\\nros2 topic

practice (use\\nWriting a simple publisher and subscriber (C++)\\nto help).\\n5 (Extra) Use an existing interface definition\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNote\\nYou can use an existing interface definition in a new interface definition.\\nFor example, letâ\\x80\\x99s say there is a message named\\nContact.msg\\nthat belongs to an existing ROS 2 package named\\nrosidl_tutorials_msgs\\n.\\nAssume that its definition is identical to our custom-made\\nAddressBook.msg\\ninterface from earlier.\\nIn that case you could have defined\\nAddressBook.msg\\n(an interface in the package\\nwith\\nyour nodes) as type\\nContact\\n(an interface in a\\nseparate\\npackage).\\nYou could even define\\nAddressBook.msg\\nas an\\narray\\nof type\\nContact\\n, like so:\\nrosidl_tutorials_msgs\\n/\\nContact\\n[]\\naddress_book\\nTo generate this message you would need to declare a dependency on\\nContact.msg\\'s\\npackage,\\nrosidl_tutorials_msgs\\n, in\\npackage.xml\\n:\\n<build_depend>\\nrosidl_tutorials_msgs\\n</build_depend>\\n<exec_depend>\\nrosidl_tutorials_msgs\\n</exec_depend>\\nAnd

would also need to include the header of\\nContact.msg\\nin you publisher node in order to be able to add\\ncontacts\\nto your\\naddress_book\\n.\\n#include\\n\"rosidl_tutorials_msgs/msg/contact.hpp\"\\nYou could change the call back to something like

package where itâ\\x80\\x99s being used.\\nYou also learned how to use another interface as a field type, as well as the\\npackage.xml\\n,\\nCMakeLists.txt\\n, and\\n#include\\nstatements necessary for utilizing that feature.\\nNext steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNext you will create a simple ROS 2 package with a custom parameter that you will learn to set from a launch file.\\nAgain, you can choose to

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\n#include\\nstatements at the top are the package dependencies.\\nThe next piece of code creates the class and the constructor.\\nThe first line of this constructor creates a parameter with the name\\nmy_parameter\\nand a default value of\\nworld\\n.\\nThe parameter type is inferred from the default value, so in this case it would be set to a string type.\\nNext the\\ntimer_\\nis initialized with a period of 1000ms, which causes the\\ntimer_callback\\nfunction to be executed once a second.\\nclass\\nMinimalParam\\n:\\npublic\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nNode\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nMinimalParam\\n()\\n:\\nNode\\n(\\n\"minimal_param_node\"\\n)\\n{\\nthis\\n->\\ndeclare_parameter\\n(\\n\"my_parameter\"\\n,\\n\"world\"\\n);\\ntimer_\\n=\\nthis\\n->\\ncreate_wall_timer\\n(\\n1000\\nms\\n,\\nstd\\n::\\nbind\\n(\\n&\\nMinimalParam\\n::\\ntimer_callback\\n,\\nthis\\n));\\n}\\nThe first line of our\\ntimer_callback\\nfunction gets the parameter\\nmy_parameter\\nfrom the node, and stores it in\\nmy_param\\n.\\nNext the\\nRCLCPP_INFO\\nfunction ensures the message is logged.\\nThe\\nset_parameters\\nfunction then sets the parameter\\nmy_parameter\\nback to the default string value\\nworld\\n.\\nIn the case that the user changed the parameter externally, this

(Optional) Add ParameterDescriptor\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOptionally, you can set a descriptor for the parameter.\\nDescriptors allow you to specify a text description of the parameter and its constraints, like making it read-only, specifying a range, etc.\\nFor that to work, the code in the constructor has to be changed to:\\n// ...\\nclass\\nMinimalParam\\n:\\npublic\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nNode\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nMinimalParam\\n()\\n:\\nNode\\n(\\n\"minimal_param_node\"\\n)\\n{\\nauto\\nparam_desc\\n=\\nrcl_interfaces\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nParameterDescriptor\\n{};\\nparam_desc\\n.\\ndescription\\n=\\n\"This

source the setup files from inside\\nros2_ws\\nagain, and enter the following line:\\nros2 param list\\nThere you will see the custom parameter\\nmy_parameter\\n.\\nTo change it simply run the following line in the console:\\nros2 param set /minimal_param_node my_parameter earth\\nYou know it went well if you get the output\\nSet\\nparameter\\nsuccessful\\n.\\nIf you look at the other

directory.\\nInside the\\nros2_ws/src/python_parameters/\\ndirectory, create a new directory called\\nlaunch\\n.\\nIn there, create a new file called\\npython_parameters_launch.py\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nNode\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n\\'python_parameters\\'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n\\'minimal_param_node\\'\\n,\\nname\\n=\\n\\'custom_minimal_param_node\\'\\n,\\noutput\\n=\\n\\'screen\\'\\n,\\nemulate_tty\\n=\\nTrue\\n,\\nparameters\\n=\\n[\\n{\\n\\'my_parameter\\'\\n:\\n\\'earth\\'\\n}\\n]\\n)\\n])\\nHere

Plugins are dynamically loadable classes that are loaded from a runtime library (i.e. shared object, dynamically linked library). With pluginlib, one does not have to explicitly link their application against the library containing the classes â\\x80\\x93 instead pluginlib can open a library containing exported classes at any point without the application having any prior awareness of the library or the header file containing the class definition. Plugins are useful for extending/modifying application behavior without needing the application source code.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis tutorial assumes basic C++ knowledge and that you have\\npluginlib\\ninstalled.\\nsudo apt-get install ros-galactic-pluginlib\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this tutorial, you will create a two new packages, one that defines the base class, and the other that provides the plugins. The base class will define a generic polygon class, and then our plugins will define specific shapes.\\n1 Create the Base Class Package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nCreate a new empty package in your\\nros2_ws/src\\nfolder with the following terminal command.\\nros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake polygon_base --dependencies pluginlib --node-name area_node\\nOpen your favorite editor, edit\\nros2_ws/src/polygon_base/include/polygon_base/regular_polygon.hpp\\n, and paste the following inside of it:\\n#ifndef POLYGON_BASE_REGULAR_POLYGON_HPP\\n#define POLYGON_BASE_REGULAR_POLYGON_HPP\\nnamespace\\npolygon_base\\n{\\nclass\\nRegularPolygon\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nvirtual\\nvoid\\ninitialize\\n(\\ndouble\\nside_length\\n)\\n=\\n0\\n;\\nvirtual\\ndouble\\narea\\n()\\n=\\n0\\n;\\nvirtual\\n~\\nRegularPolygon\\n(){}\\nprotected\\n:\\nRegularPolygon\\n(){}\\n};\\n}\\n// namespace polygon_base\\n#endif\\n// POLYGON_BASE_REGULAR_POLYGON_HPP\\nThis code above should be pretty self explanatoryâ\\x80¦ weâ\\x80\\x99re creating an abstract class called\\nRegularPolygon\\n. One thing to notice is the presence of the initialize method. With\\npluginlib\\n, a constructor without parameters is required for classes so, if any parameters are required, we use the initialize method to initialize the object.\\nWe need to make this header available to other classes, so open\\nros2_ws/src/polygon_base/CMakeLists.txt\\nfor editing. Add the following lines after the\\nament_target_dependencies\\ncommand.\\ninstall(\\nDIRECTORY include/\\nDESTINATION include\\n)\\nAnd add this command before the\\nament_package\\ncommand\\nament_export_include_directories(\\ninclude\\n)\\nWe will return to this package later to write our test node.\\n2 Create the Plugin Package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow weâ\\x80\\x99re going to write two non-virtual implementations of our abstract class. Create a second empty package in your\\nros2_ws/src\\nfolder with the following terminal command.\\nros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake polygon_plugins --dependencies polygon_base pluginlib --library-name polygon_plugins\\n2.1 Source code for the plugins\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen\\nros2_ws/src/polygon_plugins/src/polygon_plugins.cpp\\nfor editing, and paste the following inside of it:\\n#include\\n<polygon_base/regular_polygon.hpp>\\n#include\\n<cmath>\\nnamespace\\npolygon_plugins\\n{\\nclass\\nSquare\\n:\\npublic\\npolygon_base\\n::\\nRegularPolygon\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nvoid\\ninitialize\\n(\\ndouble\\nside_length\\n)\\noverride\\n{\\nside_length_\\n=\\nside_length\\n;\\n}\\ndouble\\narea\\n()\\noverride\\n{\\nreturn\\nside_length_\\n*\\nside_length_\\n;\\n}\\nprotected\\n:\\ndouble\\nside_length_\\n;\\n};\\nclass\\nTriangle\\n:\\npublic\\npolygon_base\\n::\\nRegularPolygon\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nvoid\\ninitialize\\n(\\ndouble\\nside_length\\n)\\noverride\\n{\\nside_length_\\n=\\nside_length\\n;\\n}\\ndouble\\narea\\n()\\noverride\\n{\\nreturn\\n0.5\\n*\\nside_length_\\n*\\ngetHeight\\n();\\n}\\ndouble\\ngetHeight\\n()\\n{\\nreturn\\nsqrt\\n((\\nside_length_\\n*\\nside_length_\\n)\\n-\\n((\\nside_length_\\n/\\n2\\n)\\n*\\n(\\nside_length_\\n/\\n2\\n)));\\n}\\nprotected\\n:\\ndouble\\nside_length_\\n;\\n};\\n}\\n#include\\n<pluginlib/class_list_macros.hpp>\\nPLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS\\n(\\npolygon_plugins\\n::\\nSquare\\n,\\npolygon_base\\n::\\nRegularPolygon\\n)\\nPLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS\\n(\\npolygon_plugins\\n::\\nTriangle\\n,\\npolygon_base\\n::\\nRegularPolygon\\n)\\nThe implementation of the Square and Triangle classes should be fairly straightforward: save the side length, and use it to calculate the area. The only piece that is pluginlib specific is the last three lines, which invokes some magical macros that register the classes as actual plugins. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go through the arguments to the\\nPLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS\\nmacro:\\nThe fully-qualified type of the plugin class, in this case,\\npolygon_plugins::Square\\n.\\nThe fully-qualified type of the base class, in this case,\\npolygon_base::RegularPolygon\\n.\\n2.2 Plugin Declaration XML\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe steps above make it so that instances of our plugins can be created once the library they exist in is loaded, but the plugin loader still needs a way to find that library and to know what to reference within that library. To this end, weâ\\x80\\x99ll also create an XML file that, along with a special export line in the package manifest, makes all the necessary information about our plugins available to the ROS toolchain.\\nCreate\\nros2_ws/src/polygon_plugins/plugins.xml\\nwith the following code:\\n<library\\npath=\\n\"polygon_plugins\"\\n>\\n<class\\ntype=\\n\"polygon_plugins::Square\"\\nbase_class_type=\\n\"polygon_base::RegularPolygon\"\\n>\\n<description>\\nThis\\nis\\na\\nsquare\\nplugin.\\n</description>\\n</class>\\n<class\\ntype=\\n\"polygon_plugins::Triangle\"\\nbase_class_type=\\n\"polygon_base::RegularPolygon\"\\n>\\n<description>\\nThis\\nis\\na\\ntriangle\\nplugin.\\n</description>\\n</class>\\n</library>\\nA couple things to note:\\nThe\\nlibrary\\ntag gives the relative path to a library that contains the plugins that we want to export. In ROS 2, that is just the name of the library. In ROS 1 it contained the prefix\\nlib\\nor sometimes\\nlib/lib\\n(i.e.\\nlib/libpolygon_plugins\\n) but here it is simpler.\\nThe\\nclass\\ntag declares a plugin that we want to export from our library.

rosdistro?\\nHow do I use the rosdep tool?\\nAuthor: Steve Macenski\\nThis tutorial will explain how to manage external dependencies using\\nrosdep\\n.\\nWhat is rosdep?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nrosdep\\nis ROSâ\\x80\\x99s dependency management utility that can work with ROS packages and external libraries.\\nrosdep\\nis a command-line utility for identifying and installing dependencies to build or install a package.\\nIt can be or is invoked when:\\nBuilding a workspace and needing appropriate dependencies to build the packages within\\nInstall packages (e.g.\\nsudo\\napt\\ninstall\\nros-galactic-demo-nodes-cpp\\n) to check the dependencies needed for it to execute\\nand more!\\nIt has the ability to work over a single package or over a directory of packages (e.g. workspace).\\nA little about package.xml files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA packageâ\\x80\\x99s\\npackage.xml\\nfile contains a set of dependencies.\\nThe dependencies in this file are generally referred to as â\\x80\\x9crosdep keysâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThese are represented in the tags\\n<depend>\\n,\\n<test_depend>\\n,\\n<exec_depend>\\n,\\n<build_depend>\\n, and\\n<build_export_depend>\\n.\\nThey specify in what situation each of the dependencies are required in.\\nFor dependencies only used in testing the code (e.g.\\ngtest\\n), use\\ntest_depend\\n.\\nFor dependencies only used in building the code, use\\nbuild_depend\\n.\\nFor dependencies needed by headers the code exports, use\\nbuild_export_depend\\n.\\nFor dependencies only used when running the code, use\\nexec_depend\\n.\\nFor mixed purposes, use\\ndepend\\n, which covers build, export, and execution time dependencies.\\nThese dependencies are manually populated in the\\npackage.xml\\nfile by the packageâ\\x80\\x99s creators and should be an exhaustive list of any non-builtin libraries and packages it requires.\\nHow does rosdep work?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nrosdep\\nwill check for\\npackage.xml\\nfiles in its path or for a specific package and find the rosdep keys stored within.\\nThese keys are then cross-referenced against a central index to find the appropriate ROS package or software library in various package managers.\\nFinally, once the packages are found, they are installed and ready to go!\\nThe central index is known as\\nrosdistro\\n, which\\nmay be found here\\n.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ll explore that more in the next section.\\nHow do I know what keys to put in my package.xml?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nGreat question, Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad you asked!\\nFor ROS packages (e.g.\\nnav2_bt_navigator\\n), you may simply place the name of the package.\\nYou can find a list of all released ROS packages in\\nrosdistro\\nat\\n<distro>/distribution.yaml\\nfor your given ROS distribution.\\nFor non-ROS package system dependencies, we will need to find the keys for a particular library.\\nIn general, there are two files of interest:\\nrosdep/base.yaml\\nand\\nrosdep/python.yaml\\n.\\nbase.yaml\\nin general contains the\\napt\\nsystem dependencies.\\npython.yaml\\nin general contains the\\npip\\npython dependencies.\\nTo find a key, search for your library in this file (preferably ctrl+F, its long) and find the name in\\nyaml\\nthat contains it.\\nThis is the key to put in a\\npackage.xml\\nfile.\\nFor example, imagine a package had a dependency on\\ndoxygen\\nbecause it is a great piece of software that cares about quality documentation (hint hint).\\nWe would search\\nbase.yaml\\nfor\\ndoxygen\\nand come across:\\ndoxygen\\n:\\narch\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\ndebian\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nfedora\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nfreebsd\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\ngentoo\\n:\\n[\\napp-doc/doxygen\\n]\\nmacports\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nnixos\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nopenembedded\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen@meta-oe\\n]\\nopensuse\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nrhel\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nubuntu\\n:\\n[\\ndoxygen\\n]\\nThat means our rosdep key is\\ndoxygen\\n, which would resolve to those various names in different operating systemâ\\x80\\x99s package managers for installation.\\nWhat if my library isnâ\\x80\\x99t in rosdistro?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf your library isnâ\\x80\\x99t in\\nrosdistro\\n, you can experience the greatness that is open-source software development: you can add it yourself!\\nPull requests for rosdistro are typically merged well within a week.\\nDetailed instructions may be found here\\nfor how to contribute new rosdep keys.\\nIf for some reason these may not be contributed openly, it is possible to fork rosdistro and maintain a alternate index for use.\\nHow do I use the rosdep tool?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that we have some understanding of\\nrosdep\\n,\\npackage.xml\\n, and\\nrosdistro\\n, weâ\\x80\\x99re ready to use the utility itself!\\nFirstly, if this is the first time using\\nrosdep\\n, it must be initialized via:\\nsudo\\nrosdep\\ninit\\nrosdep\\nupdate\\nThis will initialize rosdep and\\nupdate\\nwill update the locally cached rosdistro index.\\nIt is a good idea to\\nupdate\\nrosdep on occasion to get the latest index.\\nFinally, we can run\\nrosdep\\ninstall\\nto install dependencies.\\nTypically, this is run over a workspace with many packages in a single call to install all dependencies.\\nA call for that would appear as the following, if in the root of the workspace with directory\\nsrc\\ncontaining source code.\\nrosdep\\ninstall\\n--from-paths\\nsrc\\n-y\\n--ignore-src\\nBreaking that down:\\n--from-paths\\nsrc\\nspecifies the path to check for\\npackage.xml\\nfiles to resolve keys for\\n-y\\nmeans to default yes to all prompts from the package manager to install without prompts\\n--ignore-src\\nmeans to ignore installing dependencies, even if a rosdep key exists, if the package itself is also in the workspace.\\nThere are additional arguments and options available.\\nUse\\nrosdep\\n-h\\nto see them.\"},\n",

Defining an action\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nActions are defined in\\n.action\\nfiles of the form:\\n# Request\\n---\\n# Result\\n---\\n# Feedback\\nAn action definition is made up of three message definitions separated by\\n---\\n.\\nA\\nrequest\\nmessage is sent from an action client to an action server initiating a new goal.\\nA\\nresult\\nmessage is sent from an action server to an action client when a goal is done.\\nFeedback\\nmessages are periodically sent from an action server to an action client with updates about a goal.\\nAn instance of an action is typically referred to as a\\ngoal\\n.\\nSay we want to define a new action â\\x80\\x9cFibonacciâ\\x80\\x9d for computing the\\nFibonacci sequence\\n.\\nCreate an\\naction\\ndirectory in our ROS 2

the\\norder\\nof the Fibonacci sequence we want to compute, the result is the final\\nsequence\\n, and the feedback is the\\npartial_sequence\\ncomputed so far.\\n2 Building an action\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore we can use the new Fibonacci action type in our code, we must pass the definition to the rosidl code generation pipeline.\\nThis is accomplished by adding the following lines to our\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nbefore the\\nament_package()\\nline, in the\\naction_tutorials_interfaces\\n:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nrosidl_default_generators\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n(\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\n\"action/Fibonacci.action\"\\n)\\nWe should also add the required dependencies to our\\npackage.xml\\n:\\n<buildtool_depend>\\nrosidl_default_generators\\n</buildtool_depend>\\n<depend>\\naction_msgs\\n</depend>\\n<member_of_group>\\nrosidl_interface_packages\\n</member_of_group>\\nNote, we need to depend on\\naction_msgs\\nsince action definitions include additional metadata (e.g. goal IDs).\\nWe should now be able to build the package containing the\\nFibonacci\\naction definition:\\n# Change to the root of the workspace\\ncd\\n~/ros2_ws\\n# Build\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re done!\\nBy convention, action types will be prefixed by their package name and the word\\naction\\n.\\nSo when we want to refer to our new action, it will have the full name\\naction_tutorials_interfaces/action/Fibonacci\\n.\\nWe can check that our action built successfully with the command line tool:\\n# Source our workspace\\n# On Windows: call install/setup.bat\\n.\\ninstall/setup.bash\\n# Check that our action definition

method\\nget_result_async()\\n.\\nSimilar to sending the goal, we will get a future that will complete when the result is ready.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s register a callback just like we did for the goal

and\\ncomposition\\npackages, and can be run with the following commands.\\nDiscover available components\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo see what components are registered and available in the workspace, execute the following in a shell:\\nros2\\ncomponent\\ntypes\\nThe terminal will return the list of all available components:\\n(\\n...\\ncomponents\\nof\\nother\\npackages\\nhere\\n)\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Talker\\ncomposition::Listener\\ncomposition::NodeLikeListener\\ncomposition::Server\\ncomposition::Client\\n(\\n...\\ncomponents\\nof\\nother\\npackages\\nhere\\n)\\nRun-time composition using ROS services with a publisher and subscriber\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the first shell, start the component container:\\nros2\\nrun\\nrclcpp_components\\ncomponent_container\\nOpen the second shell and verify that the container is running via\\nros2\\ncommand line tools:\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nlist\\nYou should see a name of the component:\\n/ComponentManager\\nIn the second shell load the talker component (see\\ntalker\\nsource code):\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Talker\\nThe command will return the unique ID of the loaded component as well as the node name:\\nLoaded\\ncomponent\\n1\\ninto\\n'/ComponentManager'\\ncontainer\\nnode\\nas\\n'/talker'\\nNow the first shell should show a message that the component was loaded as well as repeated message for publishing a message.\\nRun another command in the second shell to load the listener component (see\\nlistener\\nsource code):\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Listener\\nTerminal will return:\\nLoaded\\ncomponent\\n2\\ninto\\n'/ComponentManager'\\ncontainer\\nnode\\nas\\n'/listener'\\nThe\\nros2\\ncommand line utility can now be used to inspect the state of the container:\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nlist\\nYou will see the following result:\\n/ComponentManager\\n1\\n/talker\\n2\\n/listener\\nNow the first shell should show repeated output for each received message.\\nRun-time composition using ROS services with a server and client\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe example with a server and a client is very similar.\\nIn the first shell:\\nros2\\nrun\\nrclcpp_components\\ncomponent_container\\nIn the second shell (see\\nserver\\nand\\nclient\\nsource code):\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Server\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Client\\nIn this case the client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and replies with a response, and the client prints the received response.\\nCompile-time composition using ROS services\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis demos shows that the same shared libraries can be reused to compile a single executable running multiple components.\\nThe executable contains all four components from above: talker and listener as well as server and client.\\nIn the shell call (see\\nsource code\\n):\\nros2\\nrun\\ncomposition\\nmanual_composition\\nThis should show repeated messages from both pairs, the talker and the listener as well as the server and the client.\\nNote\\nManually-composed components will not be reflected in the\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nlist\\ncommand line tool

is on how to structure launch files so they may be reused as much as possible in different situations.\\nAdditionally, it covers usage examples of different ROS 2 launch tools, like parameters, YAML files, remappings, namespaces, default arguments, and RViz configs.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis tutorial uses the\\nturtlesim\\nand\\nturtle_tf2_py\\npackages.\\nThis tutorial also assumes you have\\ncreated a new package\\nof build type\\nament_python\\ncalled\\nlaunch_tutorial\\n.\\nIntroduction\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLarge applications on a robot typically involve several interconnected nodes, each of which can have many parameters.\\nSimulation of multiple turtles in the turtle simulator can serve as a good example.\\nThe turtle simulation consists of multiple turtle nodes, the world configuration, and the TF broadcaster and listener nodes.\\nBetween all of the nodes, there are a large number of ROS parameters that affect the behavior and appearance of these nodes.\\nROS 2 launch files allow us to start all nodes and set corresponding parameters in one place.\\nBy the end of a tutorial, you will build the\\nlaunch_turtlesim.launch.py\\nlaunch file in the\\nlaunch_tutorial\\npackage.\\nThis launch file will bring up different nodes responsible for the simulation of two turtlesim simulations, starting TF broadcasters and listener, loading parameters, and launching an RViz configuration.\\nIn this tutorial, weâ\\x80\\x99ll go over this launch file and all related features used.\\nWriting launch files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Top-level organization\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOne of the aims in the process of writing launch files should be making them as reusable as possible.\\nThis could be done by clustering related nodes and configurations into separate launch files.\\nAfterwards, a top-level launch file dedicated to a specific configuration could be written.\\nThis would allow moving between identical robots to be done without changing the launch files at all.\\nEven a change such as moving from a real robot to a simulated one can be done with only a few changes.\\nWe will now go over the top-level launch file structure that makes this possible.\\nFirstly, we will create a launch file that will call separate launch files.\\nTo do this, letâ\\x80\\x99s create a\\nlaunch_turtlesim.launch.py\\nfile in the\\n/launch\\nfolder of our\\nlaunch_tutorial\\npackage.\\nimport\\nos\\nfrom\\nament_index_python.packages\\nimport\\nget_package_share_directory\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch.actions\\nimport\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch.launch_description_sources\\nimport\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nturtlesim_world_1\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/turtlesim_world_1.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nturtlesim_world_2\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/turtlesim_world_2.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nbroadcaster_listener_nodes\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/broadcaster_listener.launch.py'\\n]),\\nlaunch_arguments\\n=\\n{\\n'target_frame'\\n:\\n'carrot1'\\n}\\n.\\nitems\\n(),\\n)\\nmimic_node\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/mimic.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nfixed_frame_node\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/fixed_broadcaster.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nrviz_node\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/turtlesim_rviz.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nturtlesim_world_1\\n,\\nturtlesim_world_2\\n,\\nbroadcaster_listener_nodes\\n,\\nmimic_node\\n,\\nfixed_frame_node\\n,\\nrviz_node\\n])\\nThis launch file includes a set of other launch files.\\nEach of these included launch files contains nodes, parameters, and possibly, nested includes, which pertain to one part of the system.\\nTo be exact, we launch two turtlesim simulation worlds, TF broadcaster, TF listener, mimic, fixed frame broadcaster, and RViz nodes.\\nNote\\nDesign Tip: Top-level launch files should be short, consist of includes to other files corresponding to subcomponents of the application, and commonly changed parameters.\\nWriting launch files in the following manner makes it easy to swap out one piece of the system, as weâ\\x80\\x99ll see later.\\nHowever, there are cases when some nodes or launch files have to be launched separately due to performance and usage reasons.\\nNote\\nDesign tip: Be aware of the tradeoffs when deciding how many top-level launch files your application requires.\\n2 Parameters\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n2.1 Setting parameters in the launch file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe will begin by writing a launch file that will start our first turtlesim simulation.\\nFirst, create a new file called\\nturtlesim_world_1.launch.py\\n.\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch.actions\\nimport\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\nfrom\\nlaunch.substitutions\\nimport\\nLaunchConfiguration\\n,\\nTextSubstitution\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nNode\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nbackground_r_launch_arg\\n=\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\n(\\n'background_r'\\n,\\ndefault_value\\n=\\nTextSubstitution\\n(\\ntext\\n=\\n'0'\\n)\\n)\\nbackground_g_launch_arg\\n=\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\n(\\n'background_g'\\n,\\ndefault_value\\n=\\nTextSubstitution\\n(\\ntext\\n=\\n'84'\\n)\\n)\\nbackground_b_launch_arg\\n=\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\n(\\n'background_b'\\n,\\ndefault_value\\n=\\nTextSubstitution\\n(\\ntext\\n=\\n'122'\\n)\\n)\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nbackground_r_launch_arg\\n,\\nbackground_g_launch_arg\\n,\\nbackground_b_launch_arg\\n,\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n'turtlesim'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n'turtlesim_node'\\n,\\nname\\n=\\n'sim'\\n,\\nparameters\\n=\\n[{\\n'background_r'\\n:\\nLaunchConfiguration\\n(\\n'background_r'\\n),\\n'background_g'\\n:\\nLaunchConfiguration\\n(\\n'background_g'\\n),\\n'background_b'\\n:\\nLaunchConfiguration\\n(\\n'background_b'\\n),\\n}]\\n),\\n])\\nThis launch file starts the\\nturtlesim_node\\nnode, which starts the turtlesim simulation, with simulation configuration parameters that are defined and passed to the nodes.\\n2.2 Loading parameters from YAML file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the second launch, we will start a second turtlesim simulation with a different configuration.\\nNow create a\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nfile.\\nimport\\nos\\nfrom\\nament_index_python.packages\\nimport\\nget_package_share_directory\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nNode\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nconfig\\n=\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'config'\\n,\\n'turtlesim.yaml'\\n)\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n'turtlesim'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n'turtlesim_node'\\n,\\nnamespace\\n=\\n'turtlesim2'\\n,\\nname\\n=\\n'sim'\\n,\\nparameters\\n=\\n[\\nconfig\\n]\\n)\\n])\\nThis launch file will launch the same\\nturtlesim_node\\nwith parameter values that are loaded directly from the YAML configuration file.\\nDefining arguments and parameters in YAML files make it easy to store and load a large number of variables.\\nIn addition, YAML files can be easily exported from the current\\nros2\\nparam\\nlist.\\nTo learn how to do that, refer to the\\nUnderstand parameters\\ntutorial.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s now create a configuration file,\\nturtlesim.yaml\\n, in the\\n/config\\nfolder of our package, which will be loaded by our launch file.\\n/turtlesim2/sim\\n:\\nros__parameters\\n:\\nbackground_b\\n:\\n255\\nbackground_g\\n:\\n86\\nbackground_r\\n:\\n150\\nIf we now start the\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nlaunch file, we will start the\\nturtlesim_node\\nwith preconfigured background colors.\\nTo learn more about using parameters and using YAML files, take a look at the\\nUnderstand parameters\\ntutorial.\\n2.3 Using wildcards in YAML files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are cases when we want to set the same parameters in more than one node.\\nThese nodes could have different namespaces or names but still have the same parameters.\\nDefining separate YAML files that explicitly define namespaces and node names is not efficient.\\nA solution is to use wildcard characters, which act as substitutions for unknown characters in a text value, to apply parameters to several different nodes.\\nNow letâ\\x80\\x99s create a new\\nturtlesim_world_3.launch.py\\nfile similar to\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nto include one more\\nturtlesim_node\\nnode.\\n...\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n'turtlesim'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n'turtlesim_node'\\n,\\nnamespace\\n=\\n'turtlesim3'\\n,\\nname\\n=\\n'sim'\\n,\\nparameters\\n=\\n[\\nconfig\\n]\\n)\\nLoading the same YAML file, however, will not affect the appearance of the third turtlesim world.\\nThe reason is that its parameters are stored under another namespace as shown below:\\n/turtlesim3/sim:\\nbackground_b\\nbackground_g\\nbackground_r\\nTherefore, instead of creating a new configuration for the same node that use the same parameters, we can use wildcards syntax.\\n/**\\nwill assign all the parameters in every node, despite differences in node names and namespaces.\\nWe will now update the\\nturtlesim.yaml\\n, in the\\n/config\\nfolder in the following manner:\\n/**\\n:\\nros__parameters\\n:\\nbackground_b\\n:\\n255\\nbackground_g\\n:\\n86\\nbackground_r\\n:\\n150\\nNow include the\\nturtlesim_world_3.launch.py\\nlaunch description in our main launch file.\\nUsing that configuration file in our launch descriptions will assign\\nbackground_b\\n,\\nbackground_g\\n, and\\nbackground_r\\nparameters to specified values in\\nturtlesim3/sim\\nand\\nturtlesim2/sim\\nnodes.\\n3 Namespaces\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs you may have noticed, we have defined the namespace for the turlesim world in the\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nfile.\\nUnique namespaces allow the system to start two similar nodes without node name or topic name conflicts.\\nnamespace\\n=\\n'turtlesim2'\\n,\\nHowever, if the launch file contains a large number of nodes, defining namespaces for each of them can become tedious.\\nTo solve that issue, the\\nPushRosNamespace\\naction can be used to define the global namespace for each launch file description.\\nEvery nested node will inherit that namespace automatically.\\nTo do that, firstly, we need to remove the\\nnamespace='turtlesim2'\\nline from the\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nfile.\\nAfterwards, we need to update the\\nlaunch_turtlesim.launch.py\\nto include the following lines:\\nfrom\\nlaunch.actions\\nimport\\nGroupAction\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nPushRosNamespace\\n...\\nturtlesim_world_2\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/turtlesim_world_2.launch.py'\\n])\\n)\\nturtlesim_world_2_with_namespace\\n=\\nGroupAction\\n(\\nactions\\n=\\n[\\nPushRosNamespace\\n(\\n'turtlesim2'\\n),\\nturtlesim_world_2\\n,\\n]\\n)\\nFinally, we replace the\\nturtlesim_world_2\\nto\\nturtlesim_world_2_with_namespace\\nin the\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\nstatement.\\nAs a result, each node in the\\nturtlesim_world_2.launch.py\\nlaunch description will have a\\nturtlesim2\\nnamespace.\\n4 Reusing nodes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow create a\\nbroadcaster_listener.launch.py\\nfile.\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch.actions\\nimport\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\nfrom\\nlaunch.substitutions\\nimport\\nLaunchConfiguration\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nNode\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nDeclareLaunchArgument\\n(\\n'target_frame'\\n,\\ndefault_value\\n=\\n'turtle1'\\n,\\ndescription\\n=\\n'Target

this file, we have declared the\\ntarget_frame\\nlaunch argument with a default value of\\nturtle1\\n.\\nThe default value means that the launch file can receive an argument to forward to its nodes, or in case the argument is not provided, it will pass the default value to its nodes.\\nAfterwards, we use the\\nturtle_tf2_broadcaster\\nnode two times using different names and parameters during launch.\\nThis allows us to duplicate the same node without conflicts.\\nWe also start a\\nturtle_tf2_listener\\nnode and set its\\ntarget_frame\\nparameter that we declared and acquired above.\\n5 Parameter overrides\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRecall that we called the\\nbroadcaster_listener.launch.py\\nfile in our top-level launch file.\\nIn addition to that, we have passed it\\ntarget_frame\\nlaunch argument as shown below:\\nbroadcaster_listener_nodes\\n=\\nIncludeLaunchDescription\\n(\\nPythonLaunchDescriptionSource\\n([\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\nget_package_share_directory\\n(\\n'launch_tutorial'\\n),\\n'launch'\\n),\\n'/broadcaster_listener.launch.py'\\n]),\\nlaunch_arguments\\n=\\n{\\n'target_frame'\\n:\\n'carrot1'\\n}\\n.\\nitems\\n(),\\n)\\nThis syntax allows us to change the default goal target frame to\\ncarrot1\\n.\\nIf you would like\\nturtle2\\nto follow\\nturtle1\\ninstead of the\\ncarrot1\\n, just remove the line that defines\\nlaunch_arguments\\n.\\nThis will assign\\ntarget_frame\\nits default value, which is\\nturtle1\\n.\\n6 Remapping\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow create a\\nmimic.launch.py\\nfile.\\nfrom\\nlaunch\\nimport\\nLaunchDescription\\nfrom\\nlaunch_ros.actions\\nimport\\nNode\\ndef\\ngenerate_launch_description\\n():\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n'turtlesim'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n'mimic'\\n,\\nname\\n=\\n'mimic'\\n,\\nremappings\\n=\\n[\\n(\\n'/input/pose'\\n,\\n'/turtle2/pose'\\n),\\n(\\n'/output/cmd_vel'\\n,\\n'/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'\\n),\\n]\\n)\\n])\\nThis launch file will start the\\nmimic\\nnode, which will give commands to one turtlesim to follow the other.\\nThe node is designed to receive the target pose on the topic\\n/input/pose\\n.\\nIn our case, we want to remap the target pose from\\n/turtle2/pose\\ntopic.\\nFinally, we remap the\\n/output/cmd_vel\\ntopic to\\n/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel\\n.\\nThis way\\nturtle1\\nin our\\nturtlesim2\\nsimulation world will follow\\nturtle2\\nin our initial turtlesim world.\\n7 Config files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s now create a file

launch file will start the RViz with the configuration file defined in the\\nturtle_tf2_py\\npackage.\\nThis RViz configuration will set the world frame, enable TF visualization, and start RViz with a top-down view.\\n8 Environment Variables\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s now create the last launch file called\\nfixed_broadcaster.launch.py\\nin our

launch file shows the way environment variables can be called inside the launch files.\\nEnvironment variables can be used to define or push namespaces for distinguishing nodes on different computers or robots.\\nRunning launch files\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Update setup.py\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen\\nsetup.py\\nand add the following lines so that the launch files from the\\nlaunch/\\nfolder and configuration file from the\\nconfig/\\nwould be installed.\\nThe\\ndata_files\\nfield should now look like this:\\ndata_files\\n=\\n[\\n...\\n(\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\n'share'\\n,\\npackage_name\\n,\\n'launch'\\n),\\nglob\\n(\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\n'launch'\\n,\\n'*.launch.py'\\n))),\\n(\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\n'share'\\n,\\npackage_name\\n,\\n'config'\\n),\\nglob\\n(\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\n'config'\\n,\\n'*.yaml'\\n))),\\n],\\n2 Build and run\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo finally see the result of our code, build the package and launch the top-level launch file using the following command:\\nros2 launch launch_tutorial launch_turtlesim.launch.py\\nYou will now see the two turtlesim simulations started.\\nThere are two turtles in the first one and one in the second one.\\nIn the first simulation,\\nturtle2\\nis spawned in the bottom-left part of the world.\\nIts aim is to reach the\\ncarrot1\\nframe which is five meters away on the x-axis relative to the\\nturtle1\\nframe.\\nThe\\nturtlesim2/turtle1\\nin the second is designed to mimic the behavior of the\\nturtle2\\n.\\nIf you want to control the\\nturtle1\\n, run the teleop node.\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nAs a result, you will see a similar picture:\\nIn addition to that, the RViz should have started.\\nIt will show all turtle frames relative to the\\nworld\\nframe, whose origin is at the bottom-left corner.\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this tutorial, you learned about various tips and practices of managing large projects using ROS 2 launch files.\"},\n",

scans\\nSuppose that a new turtle named\\nturtle3\\nis created and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have good odometry, but there is an overhead camera tracking its position and publishing it as a\\nPointStamped\\nmessage in relation to the\\nworld\\nframe.\\nturtle1\\nwants to know where\\nturtle3\\nis compared to itself.\\nTo do this\\nturtle1\\nmust listen to the topic where\\nturtle3\\nâ\\x80\\x99s pose is being published, wait until transforms into the desired frame are ready, and then do its operations.\\nTo make this easier the\\ntf2_ros::MessageFilter\\nis very useful.\\nThe\\ntf2_ros::MessageFilter\\nwill take a subscription to any ROS 2 message with a header and cache it until it is possible to transform it into the target frame.\\nTasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\n1 Write the broadcaster node of PointStamped messages\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor this tutorial we will set up a demo application which has a node (in Python) to broadcast the\\nPointStamped\\nposition messages

       "  'content': \"Warning\\nYou're reading the documentation for a version of ROS 2 that has reached its EOL (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported.\\n        If you want up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nTesting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhy automatic tests?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nHere are some of the many good reasons why should we have automated tests:\\nYou can make incremental updates to your code more quickly. ROS has hundreds of packages with many interdependencies, so it can be hard to anticipate the problems a small change might cause. If your change passes the unit tests, you can be more confident that you havenâ\\x80\\x99t introduced problems â\\x80\\x94 or at least the problems arenâ\\x80\\x99t your fault.\\nYou can refactor your code with greater confidence. Passing the unit tests verifies that you havenâ\\x80\\x99t introduced any bugs while refactoring. This gives you this wonderful freedom from change fear!\\nIt leads to better designed code. Unit tests force you to write your code so that it can be more easily tested. This often means keeping your underlying functions and framework separate, which is one of our design goals with ROS code.\\nThey prevent recurring bugs (bug regressions). Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good practice to write a unit test for every bug you fix. In fact, write the unit test before you fix the bug. This will help you to precisely, or even deterministically, reproduce the bug, and much more precisely understand what the problem is. As a result, you will also create a better patch, which you can then test with your regression test to verify that the bug is fixed. That way the bug wonâ\\x80\\x99t accidentally get reintroduced if the code gets modified later on. It also means that it will be easier to convince the reviewer of the patch that the problem is solved, and the contribution is of high quality.\\nOther people can work on your code more easily (an automatic form of documentation). It can be hard to figure out whether or not youâ\\x80\\x99ve broken someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s code when you make a change. The unit tests are a tool for other developers to validate their changes. Automatic tests document your coding decisions, and communicate to other developers automatically about their violation. Thus tests become documentation for your code â\\x80\\x94 a documentation that does not need to be read for the most time, and when it does need to be inspected the test system will precisely indicate what to read (which tests fail). By writing automatic tests you make other contributors faster. This improves the entire ROS project.\\nIt is much easier to become a contributor to ROS if we have automated unit tests. It is very difficult for new external developers to contribute to your components. When they make changes to code, they are often doing it in the blind, driven by a lot of guesswork. By providing a harness of automated tests, you help them in the task. They get immediate feedback for their changes. It becomes easier to contribute to a project, and new contributors to join more easily. Also their first contributions are of higher quality, which decreases the workload on maintainers. A win-win!\\nAutomatic tests simplify maintainership. Especially for mature packages, which change more slowly, and mostly need to be updated to new dependencies, an automatic test suite helps to very quickly establish whether the package still works. This makes it much easier to decide whether the package is still supported or not.\\nAutomatic tests amplify the value of Continuous Integration. Regression tests, along with normal scenario-based requirements tests, contribute to overall body of automated tests for your component. Your component is better tested against evolution of other APIs that it depends on (CI servers will tell you better and more precisely what problems develop in your code).\\nPerhaps the most important benefit of writing tests is that tests make you a good citizen.\\nTests influence quality in the long term.\\nIt is a well accepted practice in many open-source projects.\\nBy writing regressions tests, you are contributing to long term quality of the ROS ecosystem.\\nIs this all coming for free?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOf course, there is never free lunch.\\nTo get the benefits of testing, some investment is necessary.\\nYou need to develop a test, which sometimes may be difficult or costly. Sometimes it might also be nontrivial, as the test should be automatic. Things get particularly hairy if your tests should involve special hardware (they should not: try to use simulation, mock the hardware, or narrow down the test to a smaller software problem) or require external environment, for instance human operators.\\nRegression tests and other automatic tests need to be maintained. When the design of the component changes, a lot of tests become invalidated (for instance they no longer compile, or throw runtime exceptions related to the API design). These tests fail not only because the redesign re-introduced bugs but also because they need to be updated to the new design. Occasionally, with bigger redesigns, old regression tests should be dropped.\\nLarge bodies of tests can take a long time to run, which can increase Continuous Integration server costs.\\nAvailable Tutorials:\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nRunning Tests in ROS 2 from the Command Line\\nWriting Basic Tests with Python\"},\n",

in the y direction (to our left, but to the right relative to the axes) and 0.25 meters in the z direction (up).\\nThis means that the origin for the child link will be up and to the right, regardless of the child linkâ\\x80\\x99s visual origin tag.\\nSince we didnâ\\x80\\x99t specify a rpy (roll pitch yaw) attribute, the child frame will be default have the same orientation as the parent frame.\\nNow, looking at the legâ\\x80\\x99s visual origin, it has both a xyz and rpy offset.\\nThis defines where the center of the visual element should be, relative to its origin.\\nSince we want the leg to attach at the top, we offset the origin down by setting the z offset to be -0.3 meters.\\nAnd since we want the long part of the leg to be parallel to the z axis, we rotate the visual part PI/2 around the Y axis.\\nros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=urdf/03-origins.urdf\\nThe launch file runs packages that will create TF frames for each link in your model based on your

You may want to restrict movement close to sensitive equipment.\\nFor instance, if we didnâ\\x80\\x99t want anything to collide with R2D2â\\x80\\x99s head, we might define the collision geometry to be a cylinder encasing his head to prevent anything from getting too close to his head.\\nPhysical Properties\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn order to get your model to simulate properly, you need to define several physical properties of your robot, i.e.\\nthe properties that a physics engine like Gazebo would need.\\nInertia\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEvery link element being simulated needs an inertial tag.\\nHere is a simple one.\\n<link\\nname=\\n\"base_link\"\\n>\\n<visual>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nlength=\\n\"0.6\"\\nradius=\\n\"0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<material\\nname=\\n\"blue\"\\n>\\n<color\\nrgba=\\n\"0 0 .8 1\"\\n/>\\n</material>\\n</visual>\\n<collision>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nlength=\\n\"0.6\"\\nradius=\\n\"0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n</collision>\\n<inertial>\\n<mass\\nvalue=\\n\"10\"\\n/>\\n<inertia\\nixx=\\n\"1e-3\"\\nixy=\\n\"0.0\"\\nixz=\\n\"0.0\"\\niyy=\\n\"1e-3\"\\niyz=\\n\"0.0\"\\nizz=\\n\"1e-3\"\\n/>\\n</inertial>\\n</link>\\nThis element is also a subelement of the link object.\\nThe mass is defined in kilograms.\\nThe 3x3 rotational inertia matrix is specified with the inertia element.\\nSince this is symmetrical, it can be represented by only 6 elements, as such.\\nixx\\nixy\\nixz\\nixy\\niyy\\niyz\\nixz\\niyz\\nizz\\nThis information can be provided to you by modeling programs such as MeshLab.\\nThe inertia of geometric primitives (cylinder, box, sphere) can be computed using Wikipediaâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlist of moment of inertia tensors\\n(and is used in the above example).\\nThe inertia tensor depends on both the mass and the distribution of mass of the object.\\nA good first approximation is to assume equal distribution of mass in the volume of the object and compute the inertia tensor based on the objectâ\\x80\\x99s shape, as outlined above.\\nIf unsure what to put, a matrix with ixx/iyy/izz=1e-3 or smaller is often a reasonable default for a mid-sized link (it corresponds to a box of 0.1 m side length with a mass of 0.6 kg).\\nThe identity matrix is a particularly bad choice, since it is often much too high (it corresponds to a box of 0.1 m side length with a mass of 600 kg!).\\nYou can also specify an origin tag to specify the center of gravity and the inertial reference frame (relative to the linkâ\\x80\\x99s reference frame).\\nWhen using realtime controllers, inertia elements of zero (or almost zero) can cause the robot model to collapse without warning, and all links will appear with their origins coinciding with the world origin.\\nContact Coefficients\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can also define how the links behave when they are in contact with one another.\\nThis is done with a subelement of the collision tag called contact_coefficients.\\nThere are three attributes to specify:\\nmu -\\nFriction coefficient\\nkp -\\nStiffness coefficient\\nkd -\\nDampening coefficient\\nJoint Dynamics\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nHow the joint moves is defined by the dynamics tag for the joint.\\nThere are two attributes here:\\nfriction\\n- The physical static friction.\\nFor prismatic joints, the units are Newtons.\\nFor revolving joints, the units are Newton meters.\\ndamping\\n- The physical damping value.\\nFor prismatic joints, the units are Newton seconds per meter.\\nFor revolving joints, Newton meter seconds per radian.\\nIf not specified, these coefficients default to zero.\\nOther Tags\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the realm of pure URDF (i.e. excluding Gazebo-specific tags), there are two remaining tags to help define the joints: calibration and safety controller.\\nCheck out the\\nspec\\n, as they are not included in this tutorial.\\nNext Steps\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nReduce the amount of code and annoying math you have to do by\\nusing xacro\\n.'},\n",

Xacro\\nTutorial level:\\nIntermediate\\nTime:\\n20 minutes\\nContents\\nUsing Xacro\\nConstants\\nMath\\nMacros\\nSimple Macro\\nParameterized Macro\\nPractical Usage\\nLeg macro\\nBy now, if youâ\\x80\\x99re following all these steps at home with your own robot design, you might be sick of doing all sorts of math to get very simple robot descriptions to parse correctly.\\nFortunately, you can use the\\nxacro\\npackage to make your life simpler.\\nIt does three things that are very helpful.\\nConstants\\nSimple Math\\nMacros\\nIn this tutorial, we take a look at all these shortcuts to help reduce the overall size of the URDF file and make it easier to read and maintain.\\nUsing Xacro\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs its name implies,\\nxacro\\nis a macro language for XML.\\nThe xacro program runs all of the macros and outputs the result.\\nTypical usage looks something like this:\\nxacro model.xacro > model.urdf\\nYou can also automatically generate the urdf in a launch file.\\nThis is convenient because it stays up to date and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t use up hard drive space.\\nHowever, it does take time to generate, so be aware that your launch file might take longer to start up.\\npath_to_urdf\\n=\\nget_package_share_path\\n(\\n\\'pr2_description\\'\\n)\\n/\\n\\'robots\\'\\n/\\n\\'pr2.urdf.xacro\\'\\nrobot_state_publisher_node\\n=\\nlaunch_ros\\n.\\nactions\\n.\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n\\'robot_state_publisher\\'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n\\'robot_state_publisher\\'\\n,\\nparameters\\n=\\n[{\\n\\'robot_description\\'\\n:\\nParameterValue\\n(\\nCommand\\n([\\n\\'xacro \\'\\n,\\nstr\\n(\\npath_to_urdf\\n)]),\\nvalue_type\\n=\\nstr\\n)\\n}]\\n)\\nAt the top of the URDF file, you must specify a namespace in order for the file to parse properly.\\nFor example, these are the first two lines of a valid xacro file:\\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\\n<robot\\nxmlns:xacro=\\n\"http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro\"\\nname=\\n\"firefighter\"\\n>\\nConstants\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s take a quick look at our base_link in R2D2.\\n<link\\nname=\\n\"base_link\"\\n>\\n<visual>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nlength=\\n\"0.6\"\\nradius=\\n\"0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<material\\nname=\\n\"blue\"\\n/>\\n</visual>\\n<collision>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nlength=\\n\"0.6\"\\nradius=\\n\"0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n</collision>\\n</link>\\nThe information here is a little redundant.\\nWe specify the length and radius of the cylinder twice.\\nWorse, if we want to change that, we need to do so in two different places.\\nFortunately, xacro allows you to specify properties which act as constants.\\nInstead, of the above code, we can write this.\\n<xacro:property\\nname=\\n\"width\"\\nvalue=\\n\"0.2\"\\n/>\\n<xacro:property\\nname=\\n\"bodylen\"\\nvalue=\\n\"0.6\"\\n/>\\n<link\\nname=\\n\"base_link\"\\n>\\n<visual>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nradius=\\n\"${width}\"\\nlength=\\n\"${bodylen}\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<material\\nname=\\n\"blue\"\\n/>\\n</visual>\\n<collision>\\n<geometry>\\n<cylinder\\nradius=\\n\"${width}\"\\nlength=\\n\"${bodylen}\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n</collision>\\n</link>\\nThe two values are specified in the first two lines.\\nThey can be defined just about anywhere (assuming valid XML), at any level, before or after they are used.\\nUsually they go at the top.\\nInstead of specifying the actual radius in the geometry element, we use a dollar sign and curly brackets to signify the value.\\nThis code will generate the same code shown above.\\nThe value of the contents of the ${} construct are then used to replace the ${}.\\nThis means you can combine it with other text in the attribute.\\n<xacro:property\\nname=\\nâ\\x80\\x9drobotnameâ\\x80\\x9d\\nvalue=\\nâ\\x80\\x9dmarvinâ\\x80\\x9d\\n/>\\n<link\\nname=\\nâ\\x80\\x9d${robotname}s_legâ\\x80\\x9d\\n/>\\nThis will generate\\n<link\\nname=\\nâ\\x80\\x9dmarvins_legâ\\x80\\x9d\\n/>\\nHowever, the contents in the ${} donâ\\x80\\x99t have to only be a property, which brings us to our next pointâ\\x80¦\\nMath\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can build up arbitrarily complex expressions in the ${} construct using the four basic operations (+,-,*,/), the unary minus, and parenthesis.\\nExamples:\\n<cylinder\\nradius=\\n\"${wheeldiam/2}\"\\nlength=\\n\"0.1\"\\n/>\\n<origin\\nxyz=\\n\"${reflect*(width+.02)} 0 0.25\"\\n/>\\nYou can also use more than the basic mathematical operations, like\\nsin\\nand\\ncos\\n.\\nMacros\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s the biggest and most useful component to the xacro package.\\nSimple Macro\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at a simple useless macro.\\n<xacro:macro\\nname=\\n\"default_origin\"\\n>\\n<origin\\nxyz=\\n\"0 0 0\"\\nrpy=\\n\"0 0 0\"\\n/>\\n</xacro:macro>\\n<xacro:default_origin\\n/>\\n(This is useless, since if the origin is not specified, it has the same value as this.) This code will generate the following.\\n<origin\\nrpy=\\n\"0 0 0\"\\nxyz=\\n\"0 0 0\"\\n/>\\nThe name is not technically a required element, but you need to specify it to be able to use it.\\nEvery instance of the\\n<xacro:$NAME\\n/>\\nis replaced with the contents of the\\nxacro:macro\\ntag.\\nNote that even though its not exactly the same (the two attributes have switched order), the generated XML is equivalent.\\nIf the xacro with a specified name is not found, it will not be expanded and will NOT generate an error.\\nParameterized Macro\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can also parameterize macros so that they donâ\\x80\\x99t generate the same exact text every time.\\nWhen combined with the math functionality, this is even more powerful.\\nFirst, letâ\\x80\\x99s take an example of a simple macro used in R2D2.\\n<xacro:macro\\nname=\\n\"default_inertial\"\\nparams=\\n\"mass\"\\n>\\n<inertial>\\n<mass\\nvalue=\\n\"${mass}\"\\n/>\\n<inertia\\nixx=\\n\"1e-3\"\\nixy=\\n\"0.0\"\\nixz=\\n\"0.0\"\\niyy=\\n\"1e-3\"\\niyz=\\n\"0.0\"\\nizz=\\n\"1e-3\"\\n/>\\n</inertial>\\n</xacro:macro>\\nThis can be used with the code\\n<xacro:default_inertial\\nmass=\\n\"10\"\\n/>\\nThe parameters act just like properties, and you can use them in expressions\\nYou can also use entire blocks as parameters too.\\n<xacro:macro\\nname=\\n\"blue_shape\"\\nparams=\\n\"name *shape\"\\n>\\n<link\\nname=\\n\"${name}\"\\n>\\n<visual>\\n<geometry>\\n<xacro:insert_block\\nname=\\n\"shape\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<material\\nname=\\n\"blue\"\\n/>\\n</visual>\\n<collision>\\n<geometry>\\n<xacro:insert_block\\nname=\\n\"shape\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n</collision>\\n</link>\\n</xacro:macro>\\n<xacro:blue_shape\\nname=\\n\"base_link\"\\n>\\n<cylinder\\nradius=\\n\".42\"\\nlength=\\n\".01\"\\n/>\\n</xacro:blue_shape>\\nTo specify a block parameter, include an asterisk before its parameter name.\\nA block can be inserted using the insert_block command\\nInsert the block as many times as you wish.\\nPractical Usage\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe xacro language is rather flexible in what it allows you to do.\\nHere are a few useful ways that xacro is used in the\\nR2D2 model\\n, in addition to the default inertial macro shown above.\\nTo see the model generated by a xacro file, run the same command as with previous tutorials:\\nros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=urdf/08-macroed.urdf.xacro\\n(The launch file has been running the xacro command this whole time, but since there were no macros to expand, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t matter)\\nLeg macro\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOften you want to create multiple similar looking objects in different locations.\\nYou can use a macro and some simple math to reduce the amount of code you have to write, like we do with R2â\\x80\\x99s two legs.\\n<xacro:macro\\nname=\\n\"leg\"\\nparams=\\n\"prefix reflect\"\\n>\\n<link\\nname=\\n\"${prefix}_leg\"\\n>\\n<visual>\\n<geometry>\\n<box\\nsize=\\n\"${leglen} 0.1 0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<origin\\nxyz=\\n\"0 0 -${leglen/2}\"\\nrpy=\\n\"0 ${pi/2} 0\"\\n/>\\n<material\\nname=\\n\"white\"\\n/>\\n</visual>\\n<collision>\\n<geometry>\\n<box\\nsize=\\n\"${leglen} 0.1 0.2\"\\n/>\\n</geometry>\\n<origin\\nxyz=\\n\"0 0 -${leglen/2}\"\\nrpy=\\n\"0 ${pi/2} 0\"\\n/>\\n</collision>\\n<xacro:default_inertial\\nmass=\\n\"10\"\\n/>\\n</link>\\n<joint\\nname=\\n\"base_to_${prefix}_leg\"\\ntype=\\n\"fixed\"\\n>\\n<parent\\nlink=\\n\"base_link\"\\n/>\\n<child\\nlink=\\n\"${prefix}_leg\"\\n/>\\n<origin\\nxyz=\\n\"0 ${reflect*(width+.02)} 0.25\"\\n/>\\n</joint>\\n<!-- A bunch of stuff cut -->\\n</xacro:macro>\\n<xacro:leg\\nprefix=\\n\"right\"\\nreflect=\\n\"1\"\\n/>\\n<xacro:leg\\nprefix=\\n\"left\"\\nreflect=\\n\"-1\"\\n/>\\nCommon Trick 1: Use a name prefix to get two similarly named objects.\\nCommon Trick 2: Use math to calculate joint origins.\\nIn the case that you change the size of your robot, changing a property with some math to calculate the joint offset will save a lot of trouble.\\nCommon Trick 3: Using a reflect parameter, and setting it to 1 or -1.\\nSee how we use the reflect parameter to put the legs on either side of the body in the base_to_${prefix}_leg origin.'},\n",

Statistics.\\nWith Topic Statistics enabled for your subscription, you can characterize the performance of your\\nsystem or use the data to help diagnose any present issues.\\nFor more details please see the\\nTopic Statistics Concepts Page\\n.\\nPrerequisites\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAn installation from either binaries or source.\\nIn previous tutorials, you learned how to\\ncreate a

cpp_pubsub listener_with_topic_statistics\\nNow run the talker node:\\nros2 run cpp_pubsub talker\\nThe terminal should start publishing info messages every 0.5 seconds, like so:\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 0\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 1\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 2\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 3\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_publisher]: Publishing: \"Hello World: 4\"\\nThe listener will start printing messages to the console, starting at whatever message count the publisher is on at that time, like so:\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber_with_topic_statistics]: I heard: \"Hello World: 10\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber_with_topic_statistics]: I heard: \"Hello World: 11\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber_with_topic_statistics]: I heard: \"Hello World: 12\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber_with_topic_statistics]: I heard: \"Hello World: 13\"\\n[INFO] [minimal_subscriber_with_topic_statistics]: I heard: \"Hello World: 14\"\\nNow that the subscriber node is receiving messages, it will periodically publish statistics messages.\\nWe will observe these messages in the next section.\\n3 Observe published statistic data\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhile the nodes are running, open a new terminal window.\\nExecute the following command:\\nros2 topic list\\nThis will list all currently active topics.\\nYou should see the following:\\n/parameter_events\\n/rosout\\n/statistics\\n/topic\\nIf you optionally changed the\\ntopic_stats_options.publish_topic\\nfield earlier in the tutorial,\\nthen you will see that name instead of\\n/statistics\\n.\\nThe subscriber node you created is publishing statistics, for the topic\\ntopic\\n, to the output topic\\n/statistics\\n.\\nWe can visualize this using\\nRQt\\nNow we can view the statistics data published to this topic with the following command:\\nros2 topic echo /statistics\\nThe terminal should start publishing statistics messages every 10 seconds, because the\\ntopic_stats_options.publish_period\\nsubscription configuration was optionally changed earlier in the

However, these data structures also accept an â\\x80\\x9cAllocatorâ\\x80\\x9d template argument. If you specify a custom allocator to one of these data structures, it will use that allocator for you instead of the system allocator to grow or shrink the data structure. Your custom allocator could have a pool of memory preallocated on the stack, which might be better suited to real-time applications.\\nIn the ROS 2 C++ client library (rclcpp), we are following a similar philosophy to the C++ standard library. Publishers, subscribers, and the Executor accept an Allocator template parameter that controls allocations made by that entity during execution.\\nWriting an allocator\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo write an allocator compatible with ROS 2â\\x80\\x99s allocator interface, your allocator must be compatible with the C++ standard library allocator interface.\\nThe C++11 library provides something called\\nallocator_traits\\n. The C++11 standard specifies that a custom allocator only needs to fulfil a minimal set of requirements to be used to allocate and deallocate memory in a standard way.\\nallocator_traits\\nis a generic structure that fills out other qualities of an allocator based on an allocator written with the minimal requirements.\\nFor example, the following declaration for a custom allocator would satisfy\\nallocator_traits\\n(of course, you would still need to implement the declared functions in this struct):\\ntemplate\\n<\\nclass\\nT\\n>\\nstruct\\ncustom_allocator\\n{\\nusing\\nvalue_type\\n=\\nT\\n;\\ncustom_allocator\\n()\\nnoexcept\\n;\\ntemplate\\n<\\nclass\\nU\\n>\\ncustom_allocator\\n(\\nconst\\ncustom_allocator\\n<\\nU\\n>&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\nT\\n*\\nallocate\\n(\\nstd\\n::\\nsize_t\\nn\\n);\\nvoid\\ndeallocate\\n(\\nT\\n*\\np\\n,\\nstd\\n::\\nsize_t\\nn\\n);\\n};\\ntemplate\\n<\\nclass\\nT\\n,\\nclass\\nU\\n>\\nconstexpr\\nbool\\noperator\\n==\\n(\\nconst\\ncustom_allocator\\n<\\nT\\n>&\\n,\\nconst\\ncustom_allocator\\n<\\nU\\n>&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\ntemplate\\n<\\nclass\\nT\\n,\\nclass\\nU\\n>\\nconstexpr\\nbool\\noperator\\n!=\\n(\\nconst\\ncustom_allocator\\n<\\nT\\n>&\\n,\\nconst\\ncustom_allocator\\n<\\nU\\n>&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\nYou could then access other functions and members of the allocator filled in by\\nallocator_traits\\nlike so:\\nstd::allocator_traits<custom_allocator<T>>::construct(...)\\nTo learn about the full capabilities of\\nallocator_traits\\n, see\\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator_traits\\n.\\nHowever, some compilers that only have partial C++11 support, such as GCC 4.8, still require allocators to implement a lot of boilerplate code to work with standard library structures such as vectors and strings, because these structures do not use\\nallocator_traits\\ninternally. Therefore, if youâ\\x80\\x99re using a compiler with partial C++11 support, your allocator will need to look more like this:\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nT\\n>\\nstruct\\npointer_traits\\n{\\nusing\\nreference\\n=\\nT\\n&\\n;\\nusing\\nconst_reference\\n=\\nconst\\nT\\n&\\n;\\n};\\n// Avoid declaring a reference to void with an empty specialization\\ntemplate\\n<>\\nstruct\\npointer_traits\\n<\\nvoid\\n>\\n{\\n};\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nT\\n=\\nvoid\\n>\\nstruct\\nMyAllocator\\n:\\npublic\\npointer_traits\\n<\\nT\\n>\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nusing\\nvalue_type\\n=\\nT\\n;\\nusing\\nsize_type\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nsize_t\\n;\\nusing\\npointer\\n=\\nT\\n*\\n;\\nusing\\nconst_pointer\\n=\\nconst\\nT\\n*\\n;\\nusing\\ndifference_type\\n=\\ntypename\\nstd\\n::\\npointer_traits\\n<\\npointer\\n>::\\ndifference_type\\n;\\nMyAllocator\\n()\\nnoexcept\\n;\\n~\\nMyAllocator\\n()\\nnoexcept\\n;\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nU\\n>\\nMyAllocator\\n(\\nconst\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nU\\n>\\n&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\nT\\n*\\nallocate\\n(\\nsize_t\\nsize\\n,\\nconst\\nvoid\\n*\\n=\\n0\\n);\\nvoid\\ndeallocate\\n(\\nT\\n*\\nptr\\n,\\nsize_t\\nsize\\n);\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nU\\n>\\nstruct\\nrebind\\n{\\ntypedef\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nU\\n>\\nother\\n;\\n};\\n};\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nT\\n,\\ntypename\\nU\\n>\\nconstexpr\\nbool\\noperator\\n==\\n(\\nconst\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nT\\n>\\n&\\n,\\nconst\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nU\\n>\\n&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\ntemplate\\n<\\ntypename\\nT\\n,\\ntypename\\nU\\n>\\nconstexpr\\nbool\\noperator\\n!=\\n(\\nconst\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nT\\n>\\n&\\n,\\nconst\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nU\\n>\\n&\\n)\\nnoexcept\\n;\\nWriting an example main\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOnce you have written a valid C++ allocator, you must pass it as a shared pointer to your publisher, subscriber, and executor.\\nauto\\nalloc\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nvoid\\n>>\\n();\\nauto\\npublisher\\n=\\nnode\\n->\\ncreate_publisher\\n<\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nUInt32\\n>\\n(\\n\"allocator_example\"\\n,\\n10\\n,\\nalloc\\n);\\nauto\\nmsg_mem_strat\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nmessage_memory_strategy\\n::\\nMessageMemoryStrategy\\n<\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nUInt32\\n,\\nMyAllocator\\n<>>>\\n(\\nalloc\\n);\\nauto\\nsubscriber\\n=\\nnode\\n->\\ncreate_subscription\\n<\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nUInt32\\n>\\n(\\n\"allocator_example\"\\n,\\n10\\n,\\ncallback\\n,\\nnullptr\\n,\\nfalse\\n,\\nmsg_mem_strat\\n,\\nalloc\\n);\\nstd\\n::\\nshared_ptr\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nmemory_strategy\\n::\\nMemoryStrategy\\n>\\nmemory_strategy\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nAllocatorMemoryStrategy\\n<\\nMyAllocator\\n<>>>\\n(\\nalloc\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nexecutors\\n::\\nSingleThreadedExecutor\\nexecutor\\n(\\nmemory_strategy\\n);\\nYou will also need to use your allocator to allocate any messages that you pass along the execution codepath.\\nauto\\nalloc\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nMyAllocator\\n<\\nvoid\\n>>\\n();\\nOnce youâ\\x80\\x99ve instantiated the node and added the executor to the node, itâ\\x80\\x99s time to spin:\\nuint32_t\\ni\\n=\\n0\\n;\\nwhile\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nok\\n())\\n{\\nmsg\\n->\\ndata\\n=\\ni\\n;\\ni\\n++\\n;\\npublisher\\n->\\npublish\\n(\\nmsg\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nutilities\\n::\\nsleep_for\\n(\\nstd\\n::\\nchrono\\n::\\nmilliseconds\\n(\\n1\\n));\\nexecutor\\n.\\nspin_some\\n();\\n}\\nPassing an allocator to the intra-process pipeline\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEven though we instantiated a publisher and subscriber in the same process, we arenâ\\x80\\x99t using the intra-process pipeline yet.\\nThe IntraProcessManager is a class that is usually hidden from the user, but in order to pass a custom allocator to it we need to expose it by getting it from the rclcpp Context.

node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this first example, a node with two publishers, one of them with synchronous publication mode and the other one with asynchronous publication mode, will be created.\\nrmw_fastrtps\\nuses asynchronous publication mode by default.\\nWhen the publisher invokes the write operation, the data is copied into a queue,\\na background thread (asynchronous thread) is notified about the addition to the queue, and control of the thread is returned to the user before the data is actually sent.\\nThe background thread is in charge of consuming the queue and sending the data to every matched reader.\\nOn the other hand, with synchronous publication mode the data is sent directly within the context of the user thread.\\nThis entails that any blocking call occurring during the write operation would block the user thread, thus preventing the application from continuing its operation.\\nHowever, this mode typically yields higher throughput rates at lower latencies, since there is no notification nor context switching between threads.\\nCreate the node with the publishers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFirst, create a new package

previously defined topics:\\nsync_topic\\nand another one for\\nasync_topic\\n.\\nThese last two profiles set the publication mode to\\nSYNCHRONOUS\\nor\\nASYNCHRONOUS\\naccordingly.\\nNote also that all profiles specify a\\nhistoryMemoryPolicy\\nvalue, which is needed for the example to work, and the reason will be explained later on this tutorial.\\nExecute the publisher node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou

XML file defines several configurations for publishers and subscribers.\\nYou can have a default publisher configuration profile and several topic-specific publisher profiles.\\nThe only requirement is that all publisher profiles have a different name and that there is only a single default profile.\\nThe same goes for subscribers.\\nIn order to define a configuration for a specific topic, just name the profile after the the ROS 2 topic name (like\\n/sync_topic\\nand\\n/async_topic\\nin the example),\\nand\\nrmw_fastrtps\\nwill apply this profile to all publishers and subscribers for that topic.\\nThe default configuration profile is identified by the attribute\\nis_default_profile\\nset to\\ntrue\\n, and acts as a fallback profile when there is no other one with a name matching the topic name.\\nThe environment variable\\nFASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE\\nis used to inform\\nFast DDS\\nthe path to the XML file with the configuration profiles to load.\\nRMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAmong all the configurable attributes,\\nrmw_fastrtps\\ntreats\\npublishMode\\nand\\nhistoryMemoryPolicy\\ndifferently.\\nBy default, these values are set to\\nASYNCHRONOUS\\nand\\nPREALLOCATED_WITH_REALLOC\\nwithin the\\nrmw_fastrtps\\nimplementation, and the values set on the XML file are ignored.\\nIn order to use the values in the XML file, the environment variable\\nRMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML\\nmust be set to\\n1\\n.\\nHowever, this entails\\nanother caveat\\n: If\\nRMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML\\nis set, but the XML file does not define\\npublishMode\\nor\\nhistoryMemoryPolicy\\n, these attributes take the\\nFast DDS\\ndefault value instead of the\\nrmw_fastrtps\\ndefault value.\\nThis is important, especially for\\nhistoryMemoryPolicy\\n, because the\\nFast DDS\\ndeafult value is\\nPREALLOCATED\\nwhich does not work with ROS2 topic data types.\\nTherefore, in the example, a valid value for this policy has been explicitly set (\\nDYNAMIC\\n).\\nPrioritization of rmw_qos_profile_t\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 QoS contained in\\nrmw_qos_profile_t\\nare always honored, unless set to\\n*_SYSTEM_DEFAULT\\n.\\nIn that case, XML values (or\\nFast DDS\\ndefault values in the absence of XML ones) are applied.\\nThis means that if any QoS in\\nrmw_qos_profile_t\\nis set to something other than\\n*_SYSTEM_DEFAULT\\n, the corresponding value in the XML is ignored.\\nUsing other FastDDS capabilities with XML\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAlthough we have created a node with two publishers with different configuration, it is not easy to check that they are behaving differently.\\nNow that the basics of XML profiles have been covered, let us use them to configure something which has some visual effect on the nodes.\\nSpecifically, a maximum number of matching subscribers on one of the publishers and a partition definition on the other will be set.\\nNote that these are only very simple examples among all the configuration attributes that can be tuned on\\nrmw_fastrtps\\nthrough XML files.\\nPlease refer to\\n*Fast DDS* documentation\\nto  see the whole list of attributes that can be configured through XML files.\\nLimiting the number of matching subscribers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAdd a maximum number of matched subscribers to the\\n/async_topic\\npublisher profile.\\nIt should look like this:\\n<!-- publisher profile for topic async_topic -->\\n<publisher\\nprofile_name=\\n\"/async_topic\"\\n>\\n<historyMemoryPolicy>\\nDYNAMIC\\n</historyMemoryPolicy>\\n<qos>\\n<publishMode>\\n<kind>\\nASYNCHRONOUS\\n</kind>\\n</publishMode>\\n</qos>\\n<matchedSubscribersAllocation>\\n<initial>\\n0\\n</initial>\\n<maximum>\\n1\\n</maximum>\\n<increment>\\n1\\n</increment>\\n</matchedSubscribersAllocation>\\n</publisher>\\nThe number of matching subscribers is being limited to one.\\nNow open three terminals and do not forget to source the setup files and to set the required environment variables.\\nOn the first terminal run the publisher node, and the subscriber node on the other two.\\nYou should see that only the first subscriber node receives the messages from both topics.\\nThe second one could not complete the matching process in the\\n/async_topic\\nbecause the publisher prevented it, as it had already reached its maximum of matched publishers.\\nConsequently, only the messages from the\\n/sync_topic\\nare going to be received in this third terminal:\\n[INFO] [1613127657.088860890] [sync_async_subscriber]: I heard: \\'SYNC: Hello, world! 18\\'\\n[INFO] [1613127657.588896594] [sync_async_subscriber]: I heard: \\'SYNC: Hello, world! 19\\'\\n[INFO] [1613127658.088849401] [sync_async_subscriber]: I heard: \\'SYNC: Hello, world! 20\\'\\nUsing partitions within the topic\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe partitions feature can be used to control which publishers and subscribers exchange information within the same topic.\\nPartitions introduce a logical entity isolation level concept inside the physical isolation induced by a Domain ID.\\nFor a publisher to communicate with a subscriber, they have to belong at least to one common partition.\\nPartitions represent another level to separate publishers and subscribers beyond domain and topic.\\nUnlike domain and topic, an endpoint can belong to several partitions at the same time.\\nFor certain data to be shared over different domains or topics, there must be a different publisher for each, sharing its own history of changes.\\nHowever, a single publisher can share the same data sample over different partitions using a single topic data change, thus reducing network overload.\\nLet us change the\\n/sync_topic\\npublisher to partition\\npart1\\nand create a new\\n/sync_topic\\nsubscriber which uses partition\\npart2\\n.\\nTheir profiles should now look like this:\\n<!-- publisher profile for topic sync_topic -->\\n<publisher\\nprofile_name=\\n\"/sync_topic\"\\n>\\n<historyMemoryPolicy>\\nDYNAMIC\\n</historyMemoryPolicy>\\n<qos>\\n<publishMode>\\n<kind>\\nSYNCHRONOUS\\n</kind>\\n</publishMode>\\n<partition>\\n<names>\\n<name>\\npart1\\n</name>\\n</names>\\n</partition>\\n</qos>\\n</publisher>\\n<!--

be sure to remove the â\\x80\\x9cdefault_subscriberâ\\x80\\x9d subscriber profile.\\nOpen two terminals.\\nDo not forget to source the setup files and to set the required environment variables.\\nOn the first terminal run the publisher node, and the subscriber node on the other one.\\nYou should see that only the\\n/async_topic\\nmessages are reaching the subscriber.\\nThe\\n/sync_topic\\nsubscriber is not receiving the data as it is in a different partition from the corresponding publisher.\\n[INFO] [1612972054.995410057] [sync_async_subscriber]: I

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\n#include\\nstatements at the top are the package dependencies.\\nNote the inclusion of headers from the\\nrosbag2_cpp\\npackage for the functions and structures necessary to work with bag files.\\nIn the class constructor we begin by creating the writer object we will use to write to the bag.\\nwriter_\\n=\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_unique\\n<\\nrosbag2_cpp\\n::\\nWriter\\n>\\n();\\nNow that we have a writer object, we can open the bag using it.\\nWe specify just the URI of the bag to create, leaving other options at their defaults.\\nThe default storage options are used, which means that an\\nsqlite3\\n-format bag will be created.\\nThe default conversion options are used, too, which will perform no conversion, instead storing messages in the serialisation format they are received in.\\nwriter_\\n->\\nopen\\n(\\n\"my_bag\"\\n);\\nWith the writer now set up to record data we pass to it, we create a subscription and specify a callback for it.\\nWe will write data to the bag in the callback.\\nsubscription_\\n=\\ncreate_subscription\\n<\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nString\\n>\\n(\\n\"chatter\"\\n,\\n10\\n,\\nstd\\n::\\nbind\\n(\\n&\\nSimpleBagRecorder\\n::\\ntopic_callback\\n,\\nthis\\n,\\n_1\\n));\\nThe callback itself is different from a typical callback.\\nRather than receiving an instance of the data type of the topic, we instead receive a\\nrclcpp::SerializedMessage\\n.\\nWe do this for two reasons.\\nThe message data will need to be serialised by\\nrosbag2\\nbefore being written to the bag, so rather than unserialising it when receiving the data and then re-serialising it, we ask ROS to just give us the serialised message as-is.\\nThe writer API can accept a serialised message.\\nvoid\\ntopic_callback\\n(\\nstd\\n::\\nshared_ptr\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSerializedMessage\\n>\\nmsg\\n)\\nconst\\n{\\nWithin the subscription callback, the first thing to do is determine the time stamp to use for the stored message.\\nThis can be anything appropriate to your data, but two common values are the time at which the data was produced, if known, and the time it is received.\\nThe second option, the time of reception, is used here.\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nTime\\ntime_stamp\\n=\\nthis\\n->\\nnow\\n();\\nWe can then write the message into the bag.\\nBecause we have not yet registered any topics with the bag, we must specify the full topic information with the message.\\nThis is why we pass in the topic name and the topic type.\\nwriter_\\n->\\nwrite\\n(\\n*\\nmsg\\n,\\n\"chatter\"\\n,\\n\"std_msgs/msg/String\"\\n,\\ntime_stamp\\n);\\nThe class contains two member variables.\\nThe subscription object.\\nNote that the template parameter is the type of the callback, not the type of the topic.\\nIn this case the callback receives a\\nrclcpp::SerializedMessage\\nshared pointer, so this is what the template parameter must be.\\nA managed pointer to the writer object used to write to the bag.\\nNote the type of writer used here is the\\nrosbag2_cpp::Writer\\n, the generic writer interface.\\nOther writers may be available with different behaviours.\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSubscription\\n<\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSerializedMessage\\n>::\\nSharedPtr\\nsubscription_\\n;\\nstd\\n::\\nunique_ptr\\n<\\nrosbag2_cpp\\n::\\nWriter\\n>\\nwriter_\\n;\\nThe

node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAny data can be recorded into a bag, not just data received over a topic.\\nA common use case for writing to a bag from your own node is to generate and store synthetic data.\\nIn this section you will learn how to write a node that generates some data and stores it in a bag.\\nWe will demonstrate two approaches for doing this.\\nThe first uses a node with a timer; this is the approach that you would use if your data generation is external to the node, such as reading data directly from hardware (e.g. a camera).\\nThe second approach does not use a node; this is the approach you can use when you do not need to use any functionality from the ROS infrastructure.\\n4.1 Write a C++ node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside the\\nros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes/src\\ndirectory,

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nMuch of this code is the same as the first example.\\nThe important differences are described here.\\nFirst, the name of the bag is changed.\\nwriter_\\n->\\nopen\\n(\\n\"timed_synthetic_bag\"\\n);\\nIn this example we are registering the topic with the bag in advance.\\nThis is optional in most cases, but it must be done when passing in a serialised message without topic information.\\nwriter_\\n->\\ncreate_topic\\n(\\n{\\n\"synthetic\"\\n,\\n\"example_interfaces/msg/Int32\"\\n,\\nrmw_get_serialization_format\\n(),\\n\"\"\\n});\\nRather than a subscription to a topic, this node has a timer.\\nThe timer fires with a one-second period, and calls the given member function when it does.\\ntimer_\\n=\\ncreate_wall_timer\\n(\\n1\\ns\\n,\\nstd\\n::\\nbind\\n(\\n&\\nDataGenerator\\n::\\ntimer_callback\\n,\\nthis\\n));\\nWithin the timer callback, we generate (or otherwise obtain, e.g. read from a serial port connected to some hardware) the data we wish to store in the bag.\\nThe important difference between this and the previous sample is that the data is not yet serialised.\\nInstead we are passing a ROS message data type to the writer object, in this case an instance of\\nexample_interfaces/msg/Int32\\n.\\nThe writer will serialise the data for us before writing it into the bag.\\nwriter_\\n->\\nwrite\\n(\\ndata_\\n,\\n\"synthetic\"\\n,\\nnow\\n());\\n4.3 Add executable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpen the\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nfile and add the following lines after

printed to the console at a rate of one message per second.\\n5 Record synthetic data from an executable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you can create a bag that stores data from a source other than a topic, you will learn how to generate and record synthetic data from a non-node executable.\\nThe advantage of this approach is simpler code and rapid creation of a large quantity of data.\\n5.1 Write a C++ executable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside the\\nros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes/src\\ndirectory, create a new file called\\ndata_generator_executable.cpp\\nand paste the following code into

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA comparison of this sample and the previous sample will reveal that they are not that different.\\nThe only significant difference is the use of a for loop to drive the data generation rather than a timer.\\nNotice that we are also now generating time stamps for the data rather than relying on the current system time for each sample.\\nThe time stamp can be any value you need it to be.\\nThe data will be played back at the rate given by these time stamps, so this is a useful way to control the default playback speed of the samples.\\nNotice also that while the gap between each sample is a full second in time, this executable does not need to wait a second between each sample.\\nThis allows us to generate a lot of data covering a wide span of time in much less time than playback will take.\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nClock\\nclock\\n;\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nTime\\ntime_stamp\\n=\\nclock\\n.\\nnow\\n();\\nfor\\n(\\nint32_t\\nii\\n=\\n0\\n;\\nii\\n<\\n100\\n;\\n++\\nii\\n)\\n{\\nwriter_\\n->\\nwrite\\n(\\ndata\\n,\\n\"synthetic\"\\n,\\ntime_stamp\\n);\\n++\\ndata\\n.\\ndata\\n;\\ntime_stamp\\n+=\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nDuration\\n(\\n1\\ns\\n);\\n}\\n5.3

data.\\nYou may do this, for example, to save data from a topic and the result of processing that data without needing to send the processed data over a topic just to record it.\\nBecause any data can be recorded in a bag, it is also possible to save data generated by another source than a topic, such as synthetic data for training sets.\\nThis is useful, for example, for quickly generating a bag

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nimport\\nstatements at the top are the package dependencies.\\nNote the importation of the\\nrosbag2_py\\npackage for the functions and structures necessary to work with bag files.\\nIn the class constructor, we begin by creating the writer object that we will use to write to the bag.\\nWe are creating a\\nSequentialWriter\\n, which writes messages into the bag in the order received.\\nOther writers with different behaviours may be available in the\\nrosbag2\\n.\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\nSequentialWriter\\n()\\nNow that we have a writer object, we can open the bag using it.\\nWe specify the URI of the bag to create and the format (\\nsqlite3\\n), leaving other options at their defaults.\\nThe default conversion options are used, which will perform no conversion and store the messages in the serialization format they are received in.\\nstorage_options\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nStorageOptions\\n(\\nuri\\n=\\n\\'my_bag\\'\\n,\\nstorage_id\\n=\\n\\'sqlite3\\'\\n)\\nconverter_options\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nConverterOptions\\n(\\n\\'\\'\\n,\\n\\'\\'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\nopen\\n(\\nstorage_options\\n,\\nconverter_options\\n)\\nNext, we need to tell the writer about the topics we wish to store.\\nThis is done by creating a\\nTopicMetadata\\nobject and registering it with the writer.\\nThis object specifies the topic name, topic data type, and serialization format used.\\ntopic_info\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nTopicMetadata\\n(\\nname\\n=\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\ntype\\n=\\n\\'std_msgs/msg/String\\'\\n,\\nserialization_format\\n=\\n\\'cdr\\'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\ncreate_topic\\n(\\ntopic_info\\n)\\nWith the writer now set up to record data we pass to it, we create a subscription and specify a callback for it.\\nWe will write data to the bag in the callback.\\nself\\n.\\nsubscription\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nString\\n,\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nself\\n.\\ntopic_callback\\n,\\n10\\n)\\nself\\n.\\nsubscription\\nThe callback receives the message in unserialized form (as is standard for the\\nrclpy\\nAPI) and passes the message to the writer, specifying the topic that the data is for and the timestamp to record with the message.\\nHowever, the writer requires serialised message to store in the bag.\\nThis means that we need to serialise the data before passing it to the writer.\\nFor this reason, we call\\nserialize_message()\\nand pass the result of that to the writer, rather than passing in the message directly.\\ndef\\ntopic_callback\\n(\\nself\\n,\\nmsg\\n):\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\n\\'chatter\\'\\n,\\nserialize_message\\n(\\nmsg\\n),\\nself\\n.\\nget_clock\\n()\\n.\\nnow\\n()\\n.\\nnanoseconds\\n)\\nThe

write it to the\\nmy_bag\\nbag.\\nIf the\\nmy_bag\\ndirectory already exists, you must first delete it before running the\\nsimple_bag_recorder\\nnode.\\nThis is because\\nrosbag2\\nwill not overwrite existing bags by default, and so the destination directory cannot exist.\\nTerminate both nodes.\\nThen, in one terminal start the\\nlistener\\nexample node.\\nros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener\\nIn the other terminal, use\\nros2\\nbag\\nto play the bag recorded by your node.\\nros2 bag play my_bag\\nYou will see the messages from the bag being received by the\\nlistener\\nnode.\\nIf you wish to run the bag-writing node again, you will first need to delete the\\nmy_bag\\ndirectory.\\n4 Record synthetic data from a node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAny data can be recorded into a bag, not just data received over a topic.\\nA common use case for writing to a bag from your own node is to generate and store synthetic data.\\nIn this section you will learn how to write a node that generates some data and stores it in a bag.\\nWe will demonstrate two approaches for doing this.\\nThe first uses a node with a timer; this is the approach that you would use if your data generation is external to the node, such as reading data directly from hardware (e.g. a camera).\\nThe second approach does not use a node; this is the approach you can use when you do not need to use any functionality from the ROS infrastructure.\\n4.1 Write a Python node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside the\\nros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes_py/bag_recorder_nodes_py\\ndirectory, create a new file called\\ndata_generator_node.py\\nand paste the following code into it.\\nimport\\nrclpy\\nfrom\\nrclpy.node\\nimport\\nNode\\nfrom\\nrclpy.serialization\\nimport\\nserialize_message\\nfrom\\nexample_interfaces.msg\\nimport\\nInt32\\nimport\\nrosbag2_py\\nclass\\nDataGeneratorNode\\n(\\nNode\\n):\\ndef\\n__init__\\n(\\nself\\n):\\nsuper\\n()\\n.\\n__init__\\n(\\n\\'data_generator_node\\'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\ndata\\n=\\nInt32\\n()\\nself\\n.\\ndata\\n.\\ndata\\n=\\n0\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\nSequentialWriter\\n()\\nstorage_options\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nStorageOptions\\n(\\nuri\\n=\\n\\'timed_synthetic_bag\\'\\n,\\nstorage_id\\n=\\n\\'sqlite3\\'\\n)\\nconverter_options\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nConverterOptions\\n(\\n\\'\\'\\n,\\n\\'\\'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\nopen\\n(\\nstorage_options\\n,\\nconverter_options\\n)\\ntopic_info\\n=\\nrosbag2_py\\n.\\n_storage\\n.\\nTopicMetadata\\n(\\nname\\n=\\n\\'synthetic\\'\\n,\\ntype\\n=\\n\\'example_interfaces/msg/Int32\\'\\n,\\nserialization_format\\n=\\n\\'cdr\\'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\ncreate_topic\\n(\\ntopic_info\\n)\\nself\\n.\\ntimer\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_timer\\n(\\n1\\n,\\nself\\n.\\ntimer_callback\\n)\\ndef\\ntimer_callback\\n(\\nself\\n):\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\n\\'synthetic\\'\\n,\\nserialize_message\\n(\\nself\\n.\\ndata\\n),\\nself\\n.\\nget_clock\\n()\\n.\\nnow\\n()\\n.\\nnanoseconds\\n)\\nself\\n.\\ndata\\n.\\ndata\\n+=\\n1\\ndef\\nmain\\n(\\nargs\\n=\\nNone\\n):\\nrclpy\\n.\\ninit\\n(\\nargs\\n=\\nargs\\n)\\ndgn\\n=\\nDataGeneratorNode\\n()\\nrclpy\\n.\\nspin\\n(\\ndgn\\n)\\nrclpy\\n.\\nshutdown\\n()\\nif\\n__name__\\n==\\n\\'__main__\\'\\n:\\nmain\\n()\\n4.2 Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nMuch of this code is the same as the first example.\\nThe important differences are described here.\\nFirst, the name of the bag is

does.\\nself\\n.\\ntimer\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_timer\\n(\\n1\\n,\\nself\\n.\\ntimer_callback\\n)\\nWithin the timer callback, we generate (or otherwise obtain, e.g. read from a serial port connected

writer.\\nself\\n.\\nwriter\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\n\\'synthetic\\'\\n,\\nserialize_message\\n(\\nself\\n.\\ndata\\n),\\nself\\n.\\nget_clock\\n()\\n.\\nnow\\n()\\n.\\nnanoseconds\\n)\\n4.3 Add

the\\n/synthetic\\ntopic.\\nros2 topic echo /synthetic\\nYou will see the data that was generated and stored in the bag printed to the console at a rate of one message per second.\\n5 Record synthetic data from an executable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow that you can create a bag that stores data from a source other than a topic, you will learn how to generate and record synthetic data from a non-node executable.\\nThe advantage of this approach is simpler code and rapid creation of a large quantity of data.\\n5.1 Write a Python executable\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInside the\\nros2_ws/src/bag_recorder_nodes_py/bag_recorder_nodes_py\\ndirectory, create a new file called\\ndata_generator_executable.py\\nand paste the following code into

Examine the code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA comparison of this sample and the previous sample will reveal that they are not that different.\\nThe only significant difference is the use of a for loop to drive the data generation rather than a timer.\\nNotice that we are also now generating time stamps for the data rather than relying on the current system time for each sample.\\nThe time stamp can be any value you need it to be.\\nThe data will be played back at the rate given by these time stamps, so this is a useful way to control the default playback speed of the samples.\\nNotice also that while the gap between each sample is a full second in time, this executable does not need to wait a second between each sample.\\nThis allows us to generate a lot of data covering a wide span of time in much less time than playback will take.\\ntime_stamp\\n=\\nClock\\n()\\n.\\nnow\\n()\\nfor\\nii\\nin\\nrange\\n(\\n0\\n,\\n100\\n):\\ndata\\n=\\nInt32\\n()\\ndata\\n.\\ndata\\n=\\nii\\nwriter\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\n\\'synthetic\\'\\n,\\nserialize_message\\n(\\ndata\\n),\\ntime_stamp\\n.\\nnanoseconds\\n)\\ntime_stamp\\n+=\\nDuration\\n(\\nseconds\\n=\\n1\\n)\\n5.3

launch your simulation.\\nDownload\\nthis\\nworld\\nfile\\nand move it inside\\nmy_package/worlds/\\n.\\nThis is actually a fairly simple text file you can visualize in a text editor.\\nA simple robot is already included in this\\nmy_world.wbt\\nworld file.\\nNote\\nIn case you want to learn how to create your own robot model in Webots, you can check this\\ntutorial\\n.\\n3 Change the my_robot_driver.py file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nwebots_ros2_driver\\nsub-package automatically creates a ROS 2 interface for most sensors.\\nIn this task, you will extend this interface by changing the\\nmy_robot_driver.py\\nfile.\\nNote\\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to show a basic example with a minimum number of dependencies.\\nHowever, you could avoid the use of this Python plugin by using another\\nwebots_ros2\\nsub-package named\\nwebots_ros2_control\\n, introducing a new dependency.\\nThis other sub-package creates an interface with the\\nros2_control\\npackage that facilitates the control of a differential wheeled robot.\\nOpen\\nmy_package/my_package/my_robot_driver.py\\nin your favorite editor and replace its contents with the following:\\nimport\\nrclpy\\nfrom\\ngeometry_msgs.msg\\nimport\\nTwist\\nHALF_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_WHEELS\\n=\\n0.045\\nWHEEL_RADIUS\\n=\\n0.025\\nclass\\nMyRobotDriver\\n:\\ndef\\ninit\\n(\\nself\\n,\\nwebots_node\\n,\\nproperties\\n):\\nself\\n.\\n__robot\\n=\\nwebots_node\\n.\\nrobot\\nself\\n.\\n__left_motor\\n=\\nself\\n.\\n__robot\\n.\\ngetDevice\\n(\\n\\'left

you can see, the\\nMyRobotDriver\\nclass implements three methods.\\nThe first method, named\\ninit(self,\\n...)\\n, is actually the ROS node counterpart of the Python\\n__init__(self,\\n...)\\nconstructor.\\nIt first gets the robot instance from the simulation (which can be used to access the\\nWebots robot API\\n).\\nThen, it gets the two motor instances and initializes them with a target position and a target velocity.\\nFinally a ROS node is created and a callback method is registered for a ROS topic named\\n/cmd_vel\\nthat will handle\\nTwist\\nmessages.\\ndef\\ninit\\n(\\nself\\n,\\nwebots_node\\n,\\nproperties\\n):\\nself\\n.\\n__robot\\n=\\nwebots_node\\n.\\nrobot\\nself\\n.\\n__left_motor\\n=\\nself\\n.\\n__robot\\n.\\ngetDevice\\n(\\n\\'left

comes the implementation of the\\n__cmd_vel_callback(self,\\ntwist)\\ncallback private method that will be called for each\\nTwist\\nmessage received on the\\n/cmd_vel\\ntopic and will save it in the\\nself.__target_twist\\nmember variable.\\ndef\\n__cmd_vel_callback\\n(\\nself\\n,\\ntwist\\n):\\nself\\n.\\n__target_twist\\n=\\ntwist\\nFinally, the\\nstep(self)\\nmethod is called at every time step of the simulation.\\nThe call to\\nrclpy.spin_once()\\nis needed to keep the ROS node running smoothly.\\nAt each time step, the method will retrieve the desired\\nforward_speed\\nand\\nangular_speed\\nfrom\\nself.__target_twist\\n.\\nAs the motors are controlled with angular velocities, the method will then convert the\\nforward_speed\\nand\\nangular_speed\\ninto individual commands for each wheel.\\nThis conversion depends on the structure of the robot, more specifically on the radius of the wheel and the distance between them.\\ndef\\nstep\\n(\\nself\\n):\\nrclpy\\n.\\nspin_once\\n(\\nself\\n.\\n__node\\n,\\ntimeout_sec\\n=\\n0\\n)\\nforward_speed\\n=\\nself\\n.\\n__target_twist\\n.\\nlinear\\n.\\nx\\nangular_speed\\n=\\nself\\n.\\n__target_twist\\n.\\nangular\\n.\\nz\\ncommand_motor_left\\n=\\n(\\nforward_speed\\n-\\nangular_speed\\n*\\nHALF_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_WHEELS\\n)\\n/\\nWHEEL_RADIUS\\ncommand_motor_right\\n=\\n(\\nforward_speed\\n+\\nangular_speed\\n*\\nHALF_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_WHEELS\\n)\\n/\\nWHEEL_RADIUS\\nself\\n.\\n__left_motor\\n.\\nsetVelocity\\n(\\ncommand_motor_left\\n)\\nself\\n.\\n__right_motor\\n.\\nsetVelocity\\n(\\ncommand_motor_right\\n)\\n4 Create the my_robot.urdf file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou now have to create a URDF file to declare the\\nmy_robot_driver.py\\nPython plugin.\\nThis will allow the\\nwebots_ros2_driver\\nROS node to launch the plugin.\\nIn the\\nmy_package/resource\\nfolder create a text file named\\nmy_robot.urdf\\nwith this contents:\\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\\n<robot\\nname=\\n\"My robot\"\\n>\\n<webots>\\n<plugin\\ntype=\\n\"my_package.my_robot_driver.MyRobotDriver\"\\n/>\\n</webots>\\n</robot>\\nNote\\nThis simple URDF file doesnâ\\x80\\x99t contain any link or joint information about the robot as it is not needed in this tutorial.\\nHowever, URDF files usually contain much more information as explained in the\\nURDF\\n.\\n5 Create the launch file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s create now the launch file to easily launch the simulation and the ROS controller with a single command.\\nIn the\\nmy_package/launch\\nfolder create a new text

is a custom action that allows you to start a Webots simulation instance.\\nYou have to specify in the constructor which world file the simulator will open.\\nwebots\\n=\\nWebotsLauncher\\n(\\nworld\\n=\\nos\\n.\\npath\\n.\\njoin\\n(\\npackage_dir\\n,\\n\\'worlds\\'\\n,\\n\\'my_world.wbt\\'\\n)\\n)\\nA supervisor Robot is always automatically added to the world file by\\nWebotsLauncher\\n.\\nThis robot is controlled by the custom node\\nRos2Supervisor\\n, which must also be started using the\\nRos2SupervisorLauncher\\n.\\nThis node allows to spawn URDF robots directly into the world, and it also publishes useful topics like\\n/clock\\n.\\nros2_supervisor\\n=\\nRos2SupervisorLauncher\\n()\\nThen, the ROS node interacting with the simulated robot is created.\\nThis node, named\\ndriver\\n, is located in the\\nwebots_ros2_driver\\npackage.\\nLinux\\nWindows\\nmacOS\\nThe node will be able to communicate with the simulated robot by using a custom protocol based on IPC and shared memory.\\nThe node (in WSL) will be able to communicate with the simulated robot (in Webots on Windows) through a TCP connection.\\nThe node (in the docker container) will be able to communicate with the simulated robot (in Webots on macOS) through a TCP connection.\\nIn your case, you need to run a single instance of this node, because you have a single robot in the simulation.\\nBut if you had more robots in the simulation, you would have to run one instance of this node per robot.\\nWEBOTS_CONTROLLER_URL\\nis used to define the name of the robot the driver should connect to.\\nThe\\ncontroller_url_prefix()\\nmethod is mandatory, as it allows\\nwebots_ros2_driver\\nto add the correct protocol prefix depending on your platform.\\nThe\\nrobot_description\\nparameter holds the contents of the URDF file which refers to the\\nmy_robot_driver.py\\nPython plugin.\\nmy_robot_driver\\n=\\nNode\\n(\\npackage\\n=\\n\\'webots_ros2_driver\\'\\n,\\nexecutable\\n=\\n\\'driver\\'\\n,\\noutput\\n=\\n\\'screen\\'\\n,\\nadditional_env\\n=\\n{\\n\\'WEBOTS_CONTROLLER_URL\\'\\n:\\ncontroller_url_prefix\\n()\\n+\\n\\'my_robot\\'\\n},\\nparameters\\n=\\n[\\n{\\n\\'robot_description\\'\\n:\\nrobot_description\\n},\\n]\\n)\\nAfter that, the three nodes are set to be launched in the\\nLaunchDescription\\nconstructor:\\nreturn\\nLaunchDescription\\n([\\nwebots\\n,\\nmy_robot_driver\\n,\\nros2_supervisor\\n,\\nFinally, an optional part is added in order to shutdown all the nodes once Webots terminates (e.g., when it gets closed from the graphical user interface).\\nlaunch\\n.\\nactions\\n.\\nRegisterEventHandler\\n(\\nevent_handler\\n=\\nlaunch\\n.\\nevent_handlers\\n.\\nOnProcessExit\\n(\\ntarget_action\\n=\\nwebots\\n,\\non_exit\\n=\\n[\\nlaunch\\n.\\nactions\\n.\\nEmitEvent\\n(\\nevent\\n=\\nlaunch\\n.\\nevents\\n.\\nShutdown\\n())],\\n)\\n)\\n6 Modify the setup.py file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFinally, before you can start the launch file, you have to modify the\\nsetup.py\\nfile to include the extra files you added.\\nOpen\\nmy_package/setup.py\\nand replace its contents

understanding the demos\\nBackground\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS applications typically consist of a composition of individual â\\x80\\x9cnodesâ\\x80\\x9d which perform narrow tasks and are decoupled from other parts of the system.\\nThis promotes fault isolation, faster development, modularity, and code reuse, but it often comes at the cost of performance.\\nAfter ROS 1 was initially developed, the need for efficient composition of nodes became obvious and Nodelets were developed.\\nIn ROS 2 we aim to improve on the design of Nodelets by addressing some fundamental problems that required restructuring of nodes.\\nIn this demo weâ\\x80\\x99ll be highlighting how nodes can be composed manually, by defining the nodes separately but combining them in different process layouts without changing the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s code or limiting its abilities.\\nInstalling the demos\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSee the\\ninstallation instructions\\nfor details on installing ROS 2.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99ve installed ROS 2 from packages, ensure that you have\\nros-galactic-intra-process-demo\\ninstalled.\\nIf you downloaded the archive or built ROS 2 from source, it will already be part of the installation.\\nRunning and understanding the demos\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are a few different demos: some are toy problems designed to highlight features of the intra process communications functionality and some are end to end examples which use OpenCV and demonstrate the ability to recombine nodes into different configurations.\\nThe two node pipeline demo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis demo is designed to show that the intra process publish/subscribe connection can result in zero-copy transport of messages when publishing and subscribing with\\nstd::unique_ptr\\ns.\\nFirst letâ\\x80\\x99s

â\\x80\\x9cproducerâ\\x80\\x9d nodeâ\\x80\\x99s implementation in the\\nProducer\\nstruct, you can see that we have created a publisher which publishes on the â\\x80\\x9cnumberâ\\x80\\x9d topic and a timer which periodically creates a new message, prints out its address in memory and its contentâ\\x80\\x99s value and then publishes it.\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cconsumerâ\\x80\\x9d node is a bit simpler, you can see its implementation in the\\nConsumer\\nstruct, as it only subscribes to the â\\x80\\x9cnumberâ\\x80\\x9d topic and prints the address and value of the message it receives.\\nThe expectation is that the producer will print out an address and value and the consumer will print out a matching address and value.\\nThis demonstrates that intra process communication is indeed working and unnecessary copies are avoided, at least for simple graphs.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s run the demo by executing\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\ntwo_node_pipeline\\nexecutable (donâ\\x80\\x99t

first):\\n$\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\ntwo_node_pipeline\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n0\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb02303faf0\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n1\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020cf0520\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n1\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020cf0520\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n2\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020e12900\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n2\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020e12900\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n3\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020cf0520\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n3\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020cf0520\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n4\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020e12900\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n4\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb020e12900\\nPublished\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n5\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb02303cea0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n5\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fb02303cea0\\n[\\n...\\n]\\nOne thing youâ\\x80\\x99ll notice is that the messages tick along at about one per second.\\nThis is because we told the timer to fire at about once per second.\\nAlso you may have noticed that the first message (with value\\n0\\n) does not have a corresponding â\\x80\\x9cReceived message â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d line.\\nThis is because publish/subscribe is â\\x80\\x9cbest effortâ\\x80\\x9d and we do not have any â\\x80\\x9clatchingâ\\x80\\x9d like behavior enabled.\\nThis means that if the publisher publishes a message before the subscription has been established, the subscription will not receive that message.\\nThis race condition can result in the first few messages being lost.\\nIn this case, since they only come once per second, usually only the first message is lost.\\nFinally, you can see that â\\x80\\x9cPublished messageâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cReceived message â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d lines with the same value also have the same address.\\nThis shows that the address of the message being received is the same as the one that was published and that it is not a copy.\\nThis is because weâ\\x80\\x99re publishing and subscribing with\\nstd::unique_ptr\\ns which allow ownership of a message to be moved around the system safely.\\nYou can also publish and subscribe with\\nconst\\n&\\nand\\nstd::shared_ptr\\n, but zero-copy will not occur in that case.\\nThe cyclic pipeline demo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis demo is similar to the previous one, but instead of the producer creating a new message for each iteration, this demo only ever uses one message instance.\\nThis is achieved by creating a cycle in the graph and â\\x80\\x9ckicking offâ\\x80\\x9d communication by externally making one of the nodes publish before spinning the

line\\npipe1->pub->publish(msg);\\nkicks the process off, but from then on the messages are passed back and forth between the nodes by each one calling publish within its own subscription callback.\\nThe expectation here is that the nodes pass the message back and forth, once a second, incrementing the value of the message each time.\\nBecause the message is being published and subscribed to as a\\nunique_ptr\\nthe same message created at the beginning is continuously used.\\nTo test those expectations, letâ\\x80\\x99s run it:\\n$\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\ncyclic_pipeline\\nPublished\\nfirst\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n42\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n42\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\ndone\\n.\\nIncrementing\\nand\\nsending\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n43\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n43\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\ndone\\n.\\nIncrementing\\nand\\nsending\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n44\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n44\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\ndone\\n.\\nIncrementing\\nand\\nsending\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n45\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n45\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\ndone\\n.\\nIncrementing\\nand\\nsending\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n46\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n46\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\ndone\\n.\\nIncrementing\\nand\\nsending\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n47\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nReceived\\nmessage\\nwith\\nvalue:\\n47\\n,\\nand\\naddress:\\n0x7fd2ce0a2bc0\\nsleeping\\nfor\\n1\\nsecond...\\n[\\n...\\n]\\nYou should see ever increasing numbers on each iteration, starting with 42â\\x80¦ because 42, and the whole time it reuses the same message, as demonstrated by the pointer addresses which do not change, which avoids unnecessary copies.\\nThe image pipeline demo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this demo weâ\\x80\\x99ll use OpenCV to capture, annotate, and then view images.\\nNote\\nIf you are on macOS and these examples do not work or you receive an error like\\nddsi_conn_write\\nfailed\\n-1\\n, then youâ\\x80\\x99ll need to increase your system wide UDP packet size:\\n$\\nsudo\\nsysctl\\n-w\\nnet.inet.udp.recvspace\\n=\\n209715\\n$\\nsudo\\nsysctl\\n-w\\nnet.inet.udp.maxdgram\\n=\\n65500\\nThese changes will not persist after a reboot.\\nSimple pipeline\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFirst weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a pipeline of three nodes, arranged as such:\\ncamera_node\\n->\\nwatermark_node\\n->\\nimage_view_node\\nThe\\ncamera_node\\nreads from camera device\\n0\\non your computer, writes some information on the image and publishes it.\\nThe\\nwatermark_node\\nsubscribes to the output of the\\ncamera_node\\nand adds more text before publishing it too.\\nFinally, the\\nimage_view_node\\nsubscribes to the output of the\\nwatermark_node\\n, writes more text to the image and then visualizes it with\\ncv::imshow\\n.\\nIn each node the address of the message which is being sent, or which has been received, or both, is written to the image.\\nThe watermark and image view nodes are designed to modify the image without copying it and so the addresses imprinted on the image should all be the same as long as the nodes are in the same process and the graph remains organized in a pipeline as sketched above.\\nNote\\nOn some systems (weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen it happen on Linux), the address printed to the screen might not change.\\nThis is because the same unique pointer is being reused. In this situation, the pipeline is still running.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s run the demo by executing the following executable:\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\nimage_pipeline_all_in_one\\nYou should see something like this:\\nYou can pause the rendering of the image by pressing the spacebar and you can resume by pressing the spacebar again.\\nYou can also press\\nq\\nor\\nESC\\nto exit.\\nIf you pause the image viewer, you should be able to compare the addresses written on the image and see that they are the same.\\nPipeline with two image viewers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNow letâ\\x80\\x99s look at an example just like the one above, except it has two image view nodes.\\nAll the nodes are still in the same process, but now two image view windows should show up. (Note for macOS users: your image view windows might be on top of each other).\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s run it with the command:\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\nimage_pipeline_with_two_image_view\\nJust like the last example, you can pause the rendering with the spacebar and continue by pressing the spacebar a second time. You can stop the updating to inspect the pointers written to the screen.\\nAs you can see in the example image above, we have one image with all of the pointers the same and then another image with the same pointers as the first image for the first two entries, but the last pointer on the second image is different. To understand why this is happening consider the graphâ\\x80\\x99s topology:\\ncamera_node\\n->\\nwatermark_node\\n->\\nimage_view_node\\n->\\nimage_view_node2\\nThe link between the\\ncamera_node\\nand the\\nwatermark_node\\ncan use the same pointer without copying because there is only one intra process subscription to which the message should be delivered. But for the link between the\\nwatermark_node\\nand the two image view nodes the relationship is one to many, so if the image view nodes were using\\nunique_ptr\\ncallbacks then it would be impossible to deliver the ownership of the same pointer to both. It can be, however, delivered to one of them. Which one would get the original pointer is not defined, but instead is simply the last to be delivered.\\nNote that the image view nodes are not subscribed with\\nunique_ptr\\ncallbacks. Instead they are subscribed with\\nconst\\nshared_ptr\\ns. This means the system deliveres the same\\nshared_ptr\\nto both callbacks. When the first intraprocess subscription is handled, the internally stored\\nunique_ptr\\nis promoted to a\\nshared_ptr\\n. Each of the callbacks will receive shared ownership of the same message.\\nPipeline with interprocess viewer\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOne other important thing to get right is to avoid interruption of the intra process zero-copy behavior when interprocess subscriptions are made. To test this we can run the first image pipeline demo,\\nimage_pipeline_all_in_one\\n, and then run an instance of the stand alone\\nimage_view_node\\n(donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to prefix them with\\nros2\\nrun\\nintra_process_demo\\nin the terminal). This will look something like this:\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s hard to pause both images at the same time so the images may not line up, but the important thing to notice is that the\\nimage_pipeline_all_in_one\\nimage view shows the same address for each step. This means that the intra process zero-copy is preserved even when an external view is subscribed as well. You can also see that the interprocess image view has different process IDs for the first two lines of text and the process ID of the standalone image viewer in the third line of text.'},\n",

In short:\\nTo make a real-time computer system, our real-time loop must update periodically to meet deadlines.\\nWe can only tolerate a small margin of error on these deadlines (our maximum allowable jitter).\\nTo do this, we must avoid nondeterministic operations in the execution path, things like: pagefault events, dynamic memory allocation/deallocation, and synchronization primitives that block indefinitely.\\nA classic example of a controls problem commonly solved by real-time computing is balancing an\\ninverted pendulum\\n.\\nIf the controller blocked for an unexpectedly long amount of time, the pendulum would fall down or go unstable.\\nBut if the controller reliably updates at a rate faster than the motor controlling the pendulum can operate, the pendulum will successfully adapt react to sensor data to balance the pendulum.\\nNow that you know everything about real-time computing, letâ\\x80\\x99s try a demo!\\nInstall and run the demo\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe real-time demo was written with Linux operating systems in mind, since many members of the ROS community doing real-time computing use Xenomai or RT_PREEMPT as their real-time solutions.\\nSince many of the operations done in the demo to optimize performance or OS-specific, the demo only builds and runs on Linux systems.\\nSo, if you are an OSX or Windows user, donâ\\x80\\x99t try this part!\\nAlso this must be built from source using a the static DDS API.\\nCurrently the only supported implementation is Connext\\n.\\nFirst, follow the instructions to build ROS 2\\nfrom source\\nusing Connext DDS as the middleware.\\nRun the tests\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore you run make sure you have at least 8Gb of RAM free. With the memory locking, swap will not work anymore.\\nSource your ROS 2 setup.bash.\\nRun the demo binary, and redirect the output. You may want to use\\nsudo\\nin case you get permission error:\\npendulum_demo\\n>\\noutput.txt\\nWhat the heck just happened?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFirst, even though you redirected stdout, you will see some output to the console (from stderr):\\nmlockall\\nfailed\\n:\\nCannot\\nallocate\\nmemory\\nCouldn\\n't lock all cached virtual memory.\\nPagefaults\\nfrom\\nreading\\npages\\nnot\\nyet\\nmapped\\ninto\\nRAM\\nwill\\nbe\\nrecorded\\n.\\nAfter the initialization stage of the demo program, it will attempt to lock all cached memory into RAM and prevent future dynamic memory allocations using\\nmlockall\\n.\\nThis is to prevent pagefaults from loading lots of new memory into RAM.\\n(See\\nthe realtime design article\\nfor more information.)\\nThe demo will continue on as usual when this occurs.\\nAt the bottom of the output.txt file generated by the demo, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see the number of pagefaults encountered during execution:\\nrttest\\nstatistics\\n:\\n-\\nMinor\\npagefaults\\n:\\n20\\n-\\nMajor\\npagefaults\\n:\\n0\\nIf we want those pagefaults to go away, weâ\\x80\\x99ll have toâ\\x80¦\\nAdjust permissions for memory locking\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAdd to\\n/etc/security/limits.conf\\n(as sudo):\\n<\\nyour\\nusername\\n>\\n-\\nmemlock\\n<\\nlimit\\nin\\nkB\\n>\\nA limit of\\n-1\\nis unlimited.\\nIf you choose this, you may need to accompany it with\\nulimit\\n-l\\nunlimited\\nafter editing the file.\\nAfter saving the file, log out and log back in.\\nThen rerun the\\npendulum_demo\\ninvocation.\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ll either see zero pagefaults in your output file, or an error saying that a bad_alloc exception was caught.\\nIf this happened, you didnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough free memory available to lock the memory allocated for the process into RAM.\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ll need to install more RAM in your computer to see zero pagefaults!\\nOutput overview\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo see more output, we have to run the\\npendulum_logger\\nnode.\\nIn one shell with your\\ninstall/setup.bash\\nsourced, invoke:\\npendulum_logger\\nYou should see the output message:\\nLogger\\nnode\\ninitialized\\n.\\nIn another shell with setup.bash sourced, invoke\\npendulum_demo\\nagain.\\nAs soon as this executable starts, you should see the other shell constantly printing output:\\nCommanded\\nmotor\\nangle\\n:\\n1.570796\\nActual\\nmotor\\nangle\\n:\\n1.570796\\nMean\\nlatency\\n:\\n210144.000000\\nns\\nMin\\nlatency\\n:\\n4805\\nns\\nMax\\nlatency\\n:\\n578137\\nns\\nMinor\\npagefaults\\nduring\\nexecution\\n:\\n0\\nMajor\\npagefaults\\nduring\\nexecution\\n:\\n0\\nThe demo is controlling a very simple inverted pendulum simulation.\\nThe pendulum simulation calculates its position in its own thread.\\nA ROS node simulates a motor encoder sensor for the pendulum and publishes its position.\\nAnother ROS node acts as a simple PID controller and calculates the next command message.\\nThe logger node periodically prints out the pendulumâ\\x80\\x99s state and the runtime performance statistics of the demo during its execution phase.\\nAfter the\\npendulum_demo\\nis finished, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to CTRL-C out of the logger node to exit.\\nLatency\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAt the\\npendulum_demo\\nexecution, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see the final statistics collected for the demo:\\nrttest\\nstatistics\\n:\\n-\\nMinor\\npagefaults\\n:\\n0\\n-\\nMajor\\npagefaults\\n:\\n0\\nLatency\\n(\\ntime\\nafter\\ndeadline\\nwas\\nmissed\\n):\\n-\\nMin\\n:\\n3354\\nns\\n-\\nMax\\n:\\n2752187\\nns\\n-\\nMean\\n:\\n19871.8\\nns\\n-\\nStandard\\ndeviation\\n:\\n1.35819e+08\\nPendulumMotor\\nreceived\\n985\\nmessages\\nPendulumController\\nreceived\\n987\\nmessages\\nThe latency fields show you the minimum, maximum, and average latency of the update loop in nanoseconds.\\nHere, latency means the amount of time after the update was expected to occur.\\nThe requirements of a real-time system depend on the application, but letâ\\x80\\x99s say in this demo we have a 1kHz (1 millisecond) update loop, and weâ\\x80\\x99re aiming for a maximum allowable latency of 5% of our update period.\\nSo, our average latency was really good in this run, but the maximum latency was unacceptable because it actually exceeded our update loop! What happened?\\nWe may be suffering from a non-deterministic scheduler.\\nIf youâ\\x80\\x99re running a vanilla Linux system and you donâ\\x80\\x99t have the RT_PREEMPT kernel installed, you probably wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to meet the real-time goal we set for ourselves, because the Linux scheduler wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow you to arbitrarily pre-empt threads at the user level.\\nSee the\\nrealtime design article\\nfor more information.\\nThe demo attempts to set the scheduler and thread priority of the demo to be suitable for real-time performance.\\nIf this operation failed, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see an error message: â\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t set scheduling priority and policy: Operation not permittedâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nYou can get slightly better performance by following the instructions in the next section:\\nSetting permissions for the scheduler\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAdd to\\n/etc/security/limits.conf\\n(as sudo):\\n<\\nyour\\nusername\\n>\\n-\\nrtprio\\n98\\nThe range of the rtprio (real-time priority) field is 0-99.\\nHowever, do NOT set the limit to 99 because then your processes could interfere with important system processes that run at the top priority (e.g. watchdog).\\nThis demo will attempt to run the control loop at priority 98.\\nPlotting results\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nYou can plot the latency and pagefault statistics that are collected in this demo after the demo runs.\\nBecause the code has been instrumented with\\nrttest\\n, there are useful command line arguments available:\\nCommand\\nDescription\\nDefault value\\n-i\\nSpecify how many iterations to run the real-time loop\\n1000\\n-u\\nSpecify the update period with the default unit being microseconds.\\nUse the suffix â\\x80\\x9csâ\\x80\\x9d for seconds, â\\x80\\x9cmsâ\\x80\\x9d for milliseconds,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cusâ\\x80\\x9d for microseconds, and â\\x80\\x9cnsâ\\x80\\x9d for nanoseconds.\\n1ms\\n-f\\nSpecify the name of the file for writing the collected data.\\nRun the demo again with a filename to save results:\\npendulum_demo\\n-f\\npendulum_demo_results\\nThen run the\\nrttest_plot\\nscript on the resulting file:\\nrttest_plot\\npendulum_demo_results\\nThis script will produce three files:\\npendulum_demo_results_plot_latency\\n.\\nsvg\\npendulum_demo_results_plot_majflts\\n.\\nsvg\\npendulum_demo_results_plot_minflts\\n.\\nsvg\\nYou can view these plots in an image viewer of your choice.\"},\n",

with:\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nOver time you will see output from various log calls with different properties.\\nTo start with you will only see output from log calls with severity\\nINFO\\nand above (\\nWARN\\n,\\nERROR\\n,\\nFATAL\\n).\\nNote that the first message will only be logged once, though the line is reached on each iteration, as that is a property of the log call used for that message.\\nLogging directory configuration\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe logging directory can be configured through two environment variables:\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\nand\\nROS_HOME\\n.\\nThe logic is as follows:\\nUse\\n$ROS_LOG_DIR\\nif\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\nis set and not empty.\\nOtherwise, use\\n$ROS_HOME/log\\n, using\\n~/.ros\\nfor\\nROS_HOME\\nif not set or if empty.\\nFor example, to set the logging directory to\\n~/my_logs\\n:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\n=\\n~/my_logs\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nexport\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\n=\\n~/my_logs\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nset\\n\"ROS_LOG_DIR=~/my_logs\"\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nYou will then find the logs under\\n~/my_logs/\\n.\\nAlternatively, you can set\\nROS_HOME\\nand the logging directory will be relative to it (\\n$ROS_HOME/log\\n).\\nROS_HOME\\nis intended to be used by anything that needs a base directory.\\nNote that\\nROS_LOG_DIR\\nhas to be either unset or empty.\\nFor example, with\\nROS_HOME\\nset to\\n~/my_ros_home\\n:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nROS_HOME\\n=\\n~/my_ros_home\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nexport\\nROS_HOME\\n=\\n~/my_ros_home\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nset\\n\"ROS_HOME=~/my_ros_home\"\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nYou will then find the logs under\\n~/my_ros_home/log/\\n.\\nLogger level configuration: programmatically\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAfter 10 iterations the level of the logger will be set to\\nDEBUG\\n, which will cause additional messages to be logged.\\nSome of these debug messages cause additional functions/expressions to be evaluated, which were previously skipped as\\nDEBUG\\nlog calls were not enabled.\\nSee\\nthe source code\\nof the demo for further explanation of the calls used, and see the rclcpp logging documentation for a full list of supported logging calls.\\nLogger level configuration: externally\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the future there will be a generalized approach to external configuration of loggers at runtime (similar to how\\nrqt_logger_level\\nin ROS 1 allows logger configuration via remote procedural calls).\\nThis concept is not yet officially supported in ROS 2.\\nIn the meantime, this demo provides an\\nexample\\nservice that can be called externally to request configuration of logger levels for known names of loggers in the process.\\nThe demo previously started is already running this example service.\\nTo set the level of the demoâ\\x80\\x99s logger back to\\nINFO\\n, call the service with:\\nros2\\nservice\\ncall\\n/config_logger\\nlogging_demo/srv/ConfigLogger\\n\"{logger_name: \\'logger_usage_demo\\', level: INFO}\"\\nThis service call will work on any logger that is running in the process provided that you know its name.\\nThis includes the loggers in the ROS 2 core, such as\\nrcl\\n(the common client library package).\\nTo enable debug logging for\\nrcl\\n, call:\\nros2\\nservice\\ncall\\n/config_logger\\nlogging_demo/srv/ConfigLogger\\n\"{logger_name: \\'rcl\\', level: DEBUG}\"\\nYou should see debug output from\\nrcl\\nstart to show.\\nUsing the logger config component\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe server that responds to the logger configuration requests has been developed as a component so that it may be added to an existing composition-based system.\\nFor example, if you are using\\na container to run your nodes\\n, to be able to configure your loggers you only need to request that it additionally load the\\nlogging_demo::LoggerConfig\\ncomponent into the container.\\nAs an example, if you want to debug the\\ncomposition::Talker\\ndemo, you can start the talker as normal with:\\nShell 1:\\nros2\\nrun\\nrclcpp_components\\ncomponent_container\\nShell 2:\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\ncomposition\\ncomposition::Talker\\nAnd then when you want to enable debug logging, load the\\nLoggerConfig\\ncomponent with:\\nShell 2\\nros2\\ncomponent\\nload\\n/ComponentManager\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo::LoggerConfig\\nAnd finally, configure all unset loggers to the debug severity by addressing the empty-named logger.\\nNote that loggers that have been specifically configured to use a particular severity will not be affected by this call.\\nShell 2:\\nros2\\nservice\\ncall\\n/config_logger\\nlogging_demo/srv/ConfigLogger\\n\"{logger_name: \\'\\', level: DEBUG}\"\\nYou should see debug output from any previously unset loggers in the process start to appear, including from the ROS 2 core.\\nLogger level configuration: command line\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs of the Bouncy ROS 2 release, the severity level for loggers that have not had their severity set explicitly can be configured from the command line.\\nRestart the demo including the following command line argument:\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\n--ros-args\\n--log-level\\ndebug\\nThis configures the default severity for any unset logger to the debug severity level.\\nYou should see debug output from loggers from the demo itself and from the ROS 2 core.\\nThe severity level for individual loggers can be configured from the command-line.\\nRestart the demo including the following command line arguments:\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\n--ros-args\\n--log-level\\nlogger_usage_demo:\\n=\\ndebug\\nConsole output formatting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf you would like more or less verbose formatting, you can use RCUTILS_CONSOLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT environment variable.\\nFor example, to additionally get the timestamp and location of the log calls, stop the demo and restart it with the environment variable set:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_CONSOLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT\\n=\\n\"[{severity} {time}] [{name}]: {message} ({function_name}() at {file_name}:{line_number})\"\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_CONSOLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT\\n=\\n\"[{severity} {time}] [{name}]: {message} ({function_name}() at {file_name}:{line_number})\"\\n# set \"RCUTILS_CONSOLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=[{severity} {time}] [{name}]: {message} ({function_name}() at {file_name}:{line_number})\"\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nYou should see the timestamp in seconds and the function name, filename and line number additionally printed with each message.\\nThe ``time`` option is only supported as of the ROS 2 Bouncy release.\\nConsole output colorizing\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBy default, the output is colorized when itâ\\x80\\x99s targeting a terminal.\\nIf you would like to force enabling or disabling it, you can use the\\nRCUTILS_COLORIZED_OUTPUT\\nenvironment variable.\\nFor example:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_COLORIZED_OUTPUT\\n=\\n0\\n# 1 for forcing it\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_COLORIZED_OUTPUT\\n=\\n0\\n# 1 for forcing it\\n# set \"RCUTILS_COLORIZED_OUTPUT=0\"\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main\\nYou should see that debug, warn, error and fatal logs arenâ\\x80\\x99t colorized now.\\nNote\\nIn Linux and MacOS forcing colorized output means that if you redirect the output to a file, the ansi escape color codes will appear on it.\\nIn windows the colorization method relies on console APIs.\\nIf it is forced you will get a new warning saying that colorization failed.\\nThe default behavior already checks if the output is a console or not, so forcing colorization is not recommended.\\nDefault stream for console output\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn Foxy and later, the output from all debug levels goes to stderr by default.  It is possible to force all output to go to stdout by setting the\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT\\nenvironment variable to\\n1\\n.\\nFor example:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT\\n=\\n1\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT\\n=\\n1\\nset\\n\"RCUTILS_LOGGING_USE_STDOUT=1\"\\nLine buffered console output\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBy default, all logging output is unbuffered.\\nYou can force it to be buffered by setting the\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_BUFFERED_STREAM\\nenvironment variable to 1.\\nFor example:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_BUFFERED_STREAM\\n=\\n1\\nexport\\nRCUTILS_LOGGING_BUFFERED_STREAM\\n=\\n1\\nset\\n\"RCUTILS_LOGGING_BUFFERED_STREAM=1\"\\nThen run:\\nros2\\nrun\\nlogging_demo\\nlogging_demo_main'},\n",

It first gives a brief overview of docker images and how they work locally and then explores IBM Cloud and how the user can deploy their containers on it.\\nAfterwards, a short description of how the user can use their own custom packages for ROS2 from github on IBM Cloud is provided.\\nA walkthrough of how to create a cluster and utilize Kubernetes on IBM Cloud is provided and finally the Docker image is deployed on the cluster.\\nOriginally published\\nhere\\nand\\nhere\\n.\\nROS2 on IBM Cloud\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn this tutorial, we show how you can easily integrate and run ROS2 on\\nIBM Cloud with your custom packages.\\nROS2 is the new generation of ROS which gives more control over\\nmulti-robot formations. With the advancements of cloud computing, cloud\\nrobotics are becoming more important in todayâ\\x80\\x99s age. In this tutorial,\\nwe will go through a short introduction on running ROS2 on IBM Cloud. By\\nthe end of the tutorial, you will be able to create your own packages in\\nROS2 and deploy them to the cloud using docker files.\\nThe following instructions assume youâ\\x80\\x99re using Linux and have been\\ntested with Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver).\\nStep 1: Setting up yourÂ\\xa0system\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore we go into how the exact process works, lets first make sure all\\nthe required software is properly installed. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll point you towards the\\nappropriate sources to set up your system and only highlight the details\\nthat pertain to our use-case.\\na) DockerÂ\\xa0files?\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDocker files are a form of containers that can run separate from your\\nsystem, this way, you can set-up potentially hundreds of different\\nprojects without affecting one another. You can even set-up different\\nversions of Linux on one machine, without the need for virtual machine.\\nDocker files have an advantage of saving space and only utilizing your\\nsystem resources when running. In addition, dockers are versatile and\\ntransferable. They contain all the required pre-requisites to run\\nseparately, meaning that you can easily use a docker file for a specific\\nsystem or service without any cubersome steps!\\nExcited yet? Letâ\\x80\\x99s start off by installing docker to your system by\\nfollowing the following\\nlink\\n.\\nFrom the tutorial, you should have done some sanity checks to make sure\\ndocker is properly set-up. Just in case, however, letâ\\x80\\x99s run the\\nfollowing command once again that uses the hello-world docker image:\\n$\\nsudo\\ndocker\\nrun\\nhello-world\\nYou should obtain the following output:\\nHello\\nfrom\\nDocker!\\nThis\\nmessage\\nshows\\nthat\\nyour\\ninstallation\\nappears\\nto\\nbe\\nworking\\ncorrectly.\\n\\nTo\\ngenerate\\nthis\\nmessage,\\nDocker\\ntook\\nthe\\nfollowing\\nsteps:\\n1\\n.\\nThe\\nDocker\\nclient\\ncontacted\\nthe\\nDocker\\ndaemon.\\n2\\n.\\nThe\\nDocker\\ndaemon\\npulled\\nthe\\n\"hello-world\"\\nimage\\nfrom\\nthe\\nDocker\\nHub.\\n(\\namd64\\n)\\n3\\n.\\nThe\\nDocker\\ndaemon\\ncreated\\na\\nnew\\ncontainer\\nfrom\\nthat\\nimage\\nwhich\\nruns\\nthe\\nexecutable\\nthat\\nproduces\\nthe\\noutput\\nyou\\nare\\ncurrently\\nreading.\\n4\\n.\\nThe\\nDocker\\ndaemon\\nstreamed\\nthat\\noutput\\nto\\nthe\\nDocker\\nclient,\\nwhich\\nsent\\nit\\nto\\nyour\\nterminal.\\n\\nTo\\ntry\\nsomething\\nmore\\nambitious,\\nyou\\ncan\\nrun\\nan\\nUbuntu\\ncontainer\\nwith:\\n$\\ndocker\\nrun\\n-it\\nubuntu\\nbash\\n\\nShare\\nimages,\\nautomate\\nworkflows,\\nand\\nmore\\nwith\\na\\nfree\\nDocker\\nID:\\nhttps://hub.docker.com/\\n\\nFor\\nmore\\nexamples\\nand\\nideas,\\nvisit:\\nhttps://docs.docker.com/get-started/\\nb) ROS2 Image\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS\\nannounced\\nimage containers for several ROS distributions in January 2019. More\\ndetailed instructions on the use of ROS2 docker images can be found\\nhere\\n.\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s skip through that and get to real-deal right away; creating a\\nlocal ROS2 docker. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll create our own Dockerfile (instead of using a\\nready Image) since weâ\\x80\\x99ll need this method for deployment on IBM Cloud.\\nFirst, we create a new directory which will hold our Dockerfile and any\\nother files we need later on and navigate to it. Using your favorite\\n$EDITOR of choice, open a new file named\\nDockerfile\\n(make sure the\\nfile naming is correct):\\n$\\nmkdir\\n~/ros2_docker\\n\\n$\\ncd\\n~/ros2_docker\\n\\n$\\n$EDITOR\\nDockerfile\\nInsert the following in the\\nDockerfile\\n, and save it (also found\\nhere\\n):\\nFROM\\nros:foxy\\n# install ros package\\nRUN\\napt-get\\nupdate\\n&&\\napt-get\\ninstall\\n-y\\n\\\\\\nros-\\n${\\nROS_DISTRO\\n}\\n-demo-nodes-cpp\\n\\\\\\nros-\\n${\\nROS_DISTRO\\n}\\n-demo-nodes-py\\n&&\\n\\\\\\nrm\\n-rf\\n/var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n&&\\nmkdir\\n/ros2_home\\n\\nWORKDIR\\n/ros2_home\\n# launch ros package\\nCMD\\n[\\n\"ros2\"\\n,\\n\"launch\"\\n,\\n\"demo_nodes_cpp\"\\n,\\n\"talker_listener.launch.py\"\\n]\\nFROM\\n: creates a layer from the ros:foxy Docker image\\nRUN\\n: builds your container by installing vim into it and creating\\na directory called /ros2_home\\nWORKDIR\\n: informs the container where the working directory should\\nbe for it\\nOf course, you are free to change the ROS distribution (\\nfoxy\\nis used\\nhere) or change the directory name. The above docker file sets up\\nROS-foxy and installs the demo nodes for C++ and Python. Then it\\nlaunches a file which runs a talker and a listener node. We will see it\\nin action in just a few, but they act very similar to the\\npublisher-subscriber example found in the\\nROS\\nwiki\\nNow, we are ready to build the docker image to run ROS2 in it (yes, it\\nis THAT easy!).\\nNote\\n: if you have errors due to insufficient privileges or\\npermission denied\\n, try running the command with\\nsudo\\nprivileges:\\n$\\ndocker\\nbuild\\n.\\n# You will see a bunch of lines that execute the docker file instructions followed by:\\nSuccessfully\\nbuilt\\n0dc6ce7cb487\\n0dc6ce7cb487\\nwill most probably be different for you, so keep note of\\nit and copy it somewhere for reference.

If not, please check this\\nlink\\nout to get that done first.\\nWe also need to make sure that the CLI plug-in for the IBM Cloud\\nContainer Registry is installed by running the command\\n$\\nibmcloud\\nplugin\\ninstall\\ncontainer-registry\\nAfterwards, login to your ibmcloud account through the terminal:\\n$\\nibmcloud\\nlogin\\n--sso\\nFrom here, letâ\\x80\\x99s create a container registry name-space. Make sure you\\nuse a unique name that is also descriptive as to what it is. Here, I\\nused\\nros2nasr\\n.\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nnamespace-add\\nros2nasr\\nIBM cloud has a lot of shortcuts that would help us get our container\\nonto the cloud right away. The command below builds the container and\\ntags it with the name\\nros2foxy\\nand the version of\\n1\\n. Make sure\\nyou use the correct registry name you created and you are free to change\\nthe container name as you wish. The\\n.\\nat the end indicates that the\\nDockerfile\\nis in the current directory (and it is important), if not,\\nchange it to point to the directory containing the Dockerfile.\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nbuild\\n--tag\\nregistry.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:1\\n.\\nYou can now make sure that the container has been pushed to the registry\\nyou created by running the following command\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nimage-list\\nListing\\nimages...\\n\\nREPOSITORY\\nTAG\\nDIGEST\\nNAMESPACE\\nCREATED\\nSIZE\\nSECURITY\\nSTATUS\\nus.icr.io/ros2nasr/ros2foxy\\n1\\n031be29301e6\\nros2nasr\\n36\\nseconds\\nago\\n120\\nMB\\nNo\\nIssues\\n\\nOK\\nNext, it is important to log-in to your registry to run the docker\\nimage. Again, if you face a\\npermission denied\\nerror, perform the\\ncommand with sudo privileges. Afterwards, run your docker file as shown\\nbelow.\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nlogin\\nLogging\\nin\\nto\\n\\'registry.ng.bluemix.net\\'\\n...\\nLogged\\nin\\nto\\n\\'registry.ng.bluemix.net\\'\\n.\\nLogging\\nin\\nto\\n\\'us.icr.io\\'\\n...\\nLogged\\nin\\nto\\n\\'us.icr.io\\'\\n.\\n\\nOK\\n\\n$\\ndocker\\nrun\\n-v\\n-it\\nregistry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:1\\nWhere\\nros2nasr\\nis the name of the registry you created and\\nros2foxy:1\\nis the tag of the docker container and the version as\\nexplained previously.\\nYou should now see your docker file running and providing similar output\\nto that you saw when you ran it locally on your machine.\\nStep 3: Using Custom ROS2 Packages\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSo now we have the full pipeline working, from creating the Dockerfile,\\nall the way to deploying it and seeing it work on IBM Cloud. But, what\\nif we want to use a custom set of packages we (or someone else) created?\\nWell that all has to do with how you set-up your Dockerfile. Lets use\\nthe example provided by ROS2\\nhere\\n.\\nCreate a new directory with a new Dockerfile (or overwrite the existing\\none) and add the following in it (or download the file\\nhere\\n)\\nARG\\nFROM_IMAGE\\n=\\nros:foxy\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_WS\\n=\\n/opt/ros/overlay_ws\\n# multi-stage for caching\\nFROM\\n$FROM_IMAGE\\nAS\\ncacher\\n# clone overlay source\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_WS\\nWORKDIR\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\nRUN\\necho\\n\"\\\\\\nrepositories: \\\\n\\\\\\nros2/demos: \\\\n\\\\\\ntype: git \\\\n\\\\\\nurl: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git \\\\n\\\\\\nversion:\\n${\\nROS_DISTRO\\n}\\n\\\\n\\\\\\n\"\\n>\\n../overlay.repos\\nRUN\\nvcs\\nimport\\n./\\n<\\n../overlay.repos\\n# copy manifests for caching\\nWORKDIR\\n/opt\\nRUN\\nmkdir\\n-p\\n/tmp/opt\\n&&\\n\\\\\\nfind\\n./\\n-name\\n\"package.xml\"\\n|\\n\\\\\\nxargs\\ncp\\n--parents\\n-t\\n/tmp/opt\\n&&\\n\\\\\\nfind\\n./\\n-name\\n\"COLCON_IGNORE\"\\n|\\n\\\\\\nxargs\\ncp\\n--parents\\n-t\\n/tmp/opt\\n||\\ntrue\\n# multi-stage for building\\nFROM\\n$FROM_IMAGE\\nAS\\nbuilder\\n# install overlay dependencies\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_WS\\nWORKDIR\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\nCOPY\\n--from\\n=\\ncacher\\n/tmp/\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\n./src\\nRUN\\n.\\n/opt/ros/\\n$ROS_DISTRO\\n/setup.sh\\n&&\\n\\\\\\napt-get\\nupdate\\n&&\\nrosdep\\ninstall\\n-y\\n\\\\\\n--from-paths\\n\\\\\\nsrc/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_cpp\\n\\\\\\nsrc/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_py\\n\\\\\\n--ignore-src\\n\\\\\\n&&\\nrm\\n-rf\\n/var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n# build overlay source\\nCOPY\\n--from\\n=\\ncacher\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\n./src\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_MIXINS\\n=\\n\"release\"\\nRUN\\n.\\n/opt/ros/\\n$ROS_DISTRO\\n/setup.sh\\n&&\\n\\\\\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n\\\\\\n--packages-select\\n\\\\\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\n\\\\\\ndemo_nodes_py\\n\\\\\\n--mixin\\n$OVERLAY_MIXINS\\n# source entrypoint setup\\nENV\\nOVERLAY_WS\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\nRUN\\nsed\\n--in-place\\n--expression\\n\\\\\\n\\'$isource \"$OVERLAY_WS/install/setup.bash\"\\'\\n\\\\\\n/ros_entrypoint.sh\\n# run launch file\\nCMD\\n[\\n\"ros2\"\\n,\\n\"launch\"\\n,\\n\"demo_nodes_cpp\"\\n,\\n\"talker_listener.launch.py\"\\n]\\nGoing through the lines shown, we can see how we can add custom packages\\nfrom github in 4 steps:\\nCreate an overlay with custom packages cloned from Github:\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_WS\\nWORKDIR\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\nRUN\\necho\\n\"\\\\\\nrepositories: \\\\n\\\\\\nros2/demos: \\\\n\\\\\\ntype: git \\\\n\\\\\\nurl: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git \\\\n\\\\\\nversion:\\n${\\nROS_DISTRO\\n}\\n\\\\n\\\\\\n\"\\n>\\n../overlay.repos\\nRUN\\nvcs\\nimport\\n./\\n<\\n../overlay.repos\\nInstall package dependencies using rosdep\\n# install overlay dependencies\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_WS\\nWORKDIR\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\nCOPY\\n--from\\n=\\ncacher\\n/tmp/\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\n./src\\nRUN\\n.\\n/opt/ros/\\n$ROS_DISTRO\\n/setup.sh\\n&&\\n\\\\\\napt-get\\nupdate\\n&&\\nrosdep\\ninstall\\n-y\\n\\\\\\n--from-paths\\n\\\\\\nsrc/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_cpp\\n\\\\\\nsrc/ros2/demos/demo_nodes_py\\n\\\\\\n--ignore-src\\n\\\\\\n&&\\nrm\\n-rf\\n/var/lib/apt/lists/*\\nBuild the packages\\nyou need\\n# build overlay source\\nCOPY\\n--from\\n=\\ncacher\\n$OVERLAY_WS\\n/src\\n./src\\nARG\\nOVERLAY_MIXINS\\n=\\n\"release\"\\nRUN\\n.\\n/opt/ros/\\n$ROS_DISTRO\\n/setup.sh\\n&&\\n\\\\\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n\\\\\\n--packages-select\\n\\\\\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\n\\\\\\ndemo_nodes_py\\n\\\\\\n--mixin\\n$OVERLAY_MIXINS\\nRunning the launch file\\n# run launch file\\nCMD\\n[\\n\"ros2\"\\n,\\n\"launch\"\\n,\\n\"demo_nodes_cpp\"\\n,\\n\"talker_listener.launch.py\"\\n]\\nLikewise, we can change the packages used, install their dependencies,\\nand then run them.\\nBack to IBM Cloud\\nWith this Dockerfile, we can follow the same steps we did before to\\ndeploy it on IBM Cloud. Since we already have our registry created, and\\nweâ\\x80\\x99re logged in to IBM Cloud, we directly build our new Dockerfile.\\nNotice how I kept the tag the same but changed the version, this way I\\ncan update the docker image created previously. (You are free to create\\na completely new one if you want)\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nbuild\\n--tag\\nregistry.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2\\n.\\nThen, make sure you are logged in to the registry and run the new docker\\nimage:\\n$\\nibmcloud\\ncr\\nlogin\\nLogging\\nin\\nto\\n\\'registry.ng.bluemix.net\\'\\n...\\nLogged\\nin\\nto\\n\\'registry.ng.bluemix.net\\'\\n.\\nLogging\\nin\\nto\\n\\'us.icr.io\\'\\n...\\nLogged\\nin\\nto\\n\\'us.icr.io\\'\\n.\\n\\nOK\\n\\n$\\ndocker\\nrun\\n-v\\n-it\\nregistry.ng.bluemix.net/ros2nasr/ros2foxy:2\\nYou should see, again, the same output.

eclipse\\nSetup\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis tutorial assumes Eclipse Oxygen, git, and Egit (\\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/\\n) are already installed.\\nThroughout the tutorial we name the eclipse workspace the same name as the ros2 package, but this is not required.\\nHINT: We use nested projects and one Eclipse Workspace for each ROS-2 package.\\nCreate a C++ Project.\\nChoose the ROS 2 package name as the Project Name.\\nChoose a Makefile Project and Other Toolchain.\\nClick on Finish\\nOur project should be shown in the â\\x80\\x9cProject Explorerâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nInside our Project create a folder called â\\x80\\x9csrcâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nImport a git repository.\\nPut in the repository URL.\\nIMPORTANT: Use the source folder of the project we created before as the destination folder.\\nHINT: If you ran into problems choosing the destination folder path, the Eclipse Dialog needs a name in the name field.\\nImport using the new project wizard.\\nCreate a General->Project.\\nUse the git repository name as the project name.\\nIMPORTANT: Use the folder we cloned the git repository in as the â\\x80\\x9cLocationâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThe git project and the new project should be visible in the Project Explorer view.\\nThe same files are listed multiple times, but only one project is linked with Egit.\\nRepeat this procedure again.\\nImport git repository pluginlib.\\nIMPORTANT: Use a folder inside the source folder as â\\x80\\x9cDestination->Directoryâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nIMPORTANT: Use the folder we cloned the git repository in as the location for the new project.\\nRun the same procedure with the tinyxml2_vendor git repository.\\nIMPORTANT: Again use a folder inside the source folder.\\nIMPORTANT: Use the location of the folder we cloned as the new project folder.\\nNow all four Projects should be visible in the Project Explorer view.\\nClicking in the top right cornder for the Project Explorer view allows us to change the Project Presentation to Hierarchical view.\\nNow it looks like a ROS-2 project as it is on the hard drive.\\nBut this view loses the linkage to Egit, so use the Flat Project Presentation.\\nThe Egit linkage is good if you want to see e.g. which author wrote which code-line, etc.\\nGo to â\\x80\\x9cC/C++ buildâ\\x80\\x9d-section and put â\\x80\\x9camentâ\\x80\\x9d into â\\x80\\x9cBuild commandâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nGo to â\\x80\\x9cBehaviorâ\\x80\\x9d tab and unselect â\\x80\\x9ccleanâ\\x80\\x9d and put â\\x80\\x9cbuildâ\\x80\\x9d into Build textbox.\\nBefore â\\x80\\x9cBuild projectâ\\x80\\x9d will work, we need to close Eclipse.\\nOpen a shell and source the ROS-2 setup.bash file, then cd into the directory of the eclipse project (here: /home/ubu/rviz2_ws/rviz2_ws) and start Eclipse from inside this directory.\\nNow code completion, egit annotations, eclipse C/C++ Tools, etc. should all work.\\nEclipse-indexer\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOpening the main.cpp of rviz2 may show a lot of â\\x80\\x9cunresolved inclusionâ\\x80\\x9d warnings.\\nTo fix this, go to Project->Properties->C++ General->Path and Symbols.\\nClick on the â\\x80\\x9cReferencesâ\\x80\\x9d tab and select â\\x80\\x9cros2_wsâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nGo to C/C++-General->Path-and-Symbols, click on the â\\x80\\x9cSource locationsâ\\x80\\x9d tab and click on â\\x80\\x9cLink folderâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nChoose the location of qt5 includes.\\nThe next image should be shown.\\nIt is a good idea to add excludes to the source locations, so that some directories (like â\\x80\\x9cBuildâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cInstallâ\\x80\\x9d) donâ\\x80\\x99t get indexed.\\nGo to C++General->Preprocessor includes, select â\\x80\\x9cCDT GCC Built in compiler settings [Shared]â\\x80\\x9d and enter in the â\\x80\\x9ccommand to get compiler specsâ\\x80\\x9d text box the following:\\n-std\\n=\\nc++14\\nGo to â\\x80\\x9cC/C++-General->Indexerâ\\x80\\x9d and select the following in the image.\\nE.g â\\x80\\x9cindex unused headers as c filesâ\\x80\\x9d to resolve e.g. QApplication, because the QApplication headers content is only â\\x80\\x9c#include â\\x80\\x9cqapplication.hâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nAfter running the indexer (which happens later, so you will see this also later), you can see what it added\\nAfter that right-click on the rviz2 project and select â\\x80\\x9cIndexer->Rebuildâ\\x80\\x9d, which will start rebuilding the index (there is an icon in the lower right showing progress).\\nOnce the index is finished rebuilding, it should be able to resolve all includes.\\nDebugging with eclipse\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nGo to â\\x80\\x9cC/C++-Buildâ\\x80\\x9d and add to the build command:\\n-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\\n=\\nDebug\\nThen in eclipse go to â\\x80\\x9cRun->Debug Configurationsâ\\x80\\x9d

focus of this document.\\nBasic project outline\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe basic outline of the\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nof an ament package contains:\\ncmake_minimum_required\\n(\\nVERSION\\n3.5\\n)\\nproject\\n(\\nmy_project\\n)\\nament_package\\n()\\nThe argument to\\nproject\\nwill be the package name and must be identical to the package name in the\\npackage.xml\\n.\\nThe project setup is done by\\nament_package()\\nand this call must occur exactly once per package.\\nament_package()\\ninstalls the\\npackage.xml\\n, registers the package with the ament index, and installs config (and possibly target) files for CMake so that it can be found by other packages using\\nfind_package\\n.\\nSince\\nament_package()\\ngathers a lot of information from the\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nit should be the last call in your\\nCMakeLists.txt\\n.\\nAlthough it is possible to follow calls to\\nament_package()\\nby calls to\\ninstall\\nfunctions copying files and directories, it is simpler to just keep\\nament_package()\\nthe last call.\\nament_package\\ncan be given additional arguments:\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS\\n: a list of CMake files (\\n.cmake\\nor\\n.cmake.in\\ntemplates expanded by\\nconfigure_file()\\n) which should be available to clients of the package.\\nFor an example of when to use these arguments, see the discussion in\\nAdding resources\\n.\\nFor more information on how to use template files, see\\nthe official documentation\\n.\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS_POST\\n: same as\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS\\n, but the order in which the files are added differs.\\nWhile\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS\\nfiles are included before the files generated for the\\nament_export_*\\ncalls the files from\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS_POST\\nare included afterwards.\\nInstead of adding to\\nament_package\\n, you can also add to the variable\\n${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS\\nand\\n${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST\\nwith the same effect.\\nThe only difference is again the order in which the files are added with the following total order:\\nfiles added by\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS\\nfiles added by appending to\\n${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS\\nfiles added by appending to\\n${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST\\nfiles added by\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS_POST\\nAdding files and headers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are two main targets to build: libraries and executables which are built by\\nadd_library\\nand\\nadd_executable\\nrespectively.\\nWith the separation of header files and implementation in C/C++, it is not always necessary to add both files as argument to\\nadd_library\\n/\\nadd_executable\\n.\\nThe following best practice is proposed:\\nif you are building a library, put all headers which should be usable by clients and therefore must be installed into a subdirectory of the\\ninclude\\nfolder named like the package, while all other files (\\n.c/.cpp\\nand header files which should not be exported) are inside the\\nsrc\\nfolder.\\nonly cpp files are explicitly referenced in the call to\\nadd_library\\nor\\nadd_executable\\nallow to find headers via\\ntarget_include_directories\\n(\\nmy_target\\nPUBLIC\\n$<\\nBUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include\\n>\\n$<\\nINSTALL_INTERFACE:include\\n>\\n)\\nThis adds all files in the folder\\n${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include\\nto the public interface during build time and all files in the include folder (relative to\\n${CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR}\\n) when being installed.\\nIn principle, using generator expressions here is not necessary if both folders are called\\ninclude\\nand top-level with respect to\\n${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}\\nand\\n${CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR}\\n, but it is very common.\\nAdding Dependencies\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are two ways to link your packages against a new dependency.\\nThe first and recommended way is to use the ament macro\\nament_target_dependencies\\n.\\nAs an example, suppose we want to link\\nmy_target\\nagainst the linear algebra library Eigen3.\\nfind_package\\n(\\nEigen3\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nament_target_dependencies\\n(\\nmy_target\\nEigen3\\n)\\nIt includes the necessary headers and libraries and their dependencies to be correctly found by the project.\\nIt will also ensure that the include directories of all dependencies are ordered correctly when using overlay workspaces.\\nThe second way is to use\\ntarget_link_libraries\\n.\\nThe recommended way in modern CMake is to only use targets, exporting and linking against them.\\nCMake targets are namespaced, similar to C++.\\nFor instance,\\nEigen3\\ndefines the target\\nEigen3::Eigen\\n.\\nAt least until\\nCrystal\\nClemmys\\ntarget names are not supported in the\\nament_target_dependencies\\nmacro.\\nSometimes it will be necessary to call the\\ntarget_link_libaries\\nCMake function.\\nIn the example of Eigen3, the call should then look like\\nfind_package\\n(\\nEigen3\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\ntarget_link_libraries\\n(\\nmy_target\\nEigen3::Eigen\\n)\\nThis will also include necessary headers, libraries and their dependencies, but in contrast to\\nament_target_dependencies\\nit might not correctly order the dependencies when using overlay workspaces.\\nNote\\nIt should never be necessary to\\nfind_package\\na library that is not explicitly needed but is a dependency of another dependency that is explicitly needed.\\nIf that is the case, file a bug against the corresponding package.\\nBuilding a Library\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen building a reusable library, some information needs to be exported for downstream packages to easily use it.\\nament_export_targets\\n(\\nmy_libraryTargets\\nHAS_LIBRARY_TARGET\\n)\\nament_export_dependencies\\n(\\nsome_dependency\\n)\\ninstall\\n(\\nDIRECTORY\\ninclude/\\nDESTINATION\\ninclude\\n)\\ninstall\\n(\\nTARGETS\\nmy_library\\nEXPORT\\nmy_libraryTargets\\nLIBRARY\\nDESTINATION\\nlib\\nARCHIVE\\nDESTINATION\\nlib\\nRUNTIME\\nDESTINATION\\nbin\\nINCLUDES\\nDESTINATION\\ninclude\\n)\\nHere, we assume that the folder\\ninclude\\ncontains the headers which need to be exported.\\nNote that it is not necessary to put all headers into a separate folder, only those that should be included by clients.\\nHere is whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening in the snippet above:\\nThe\\nament_export_targets\\nmacro exports the targets for CMake.\\nThis is necessary to allow your libraryâ\\x80\\x99s clients to use the\\ntarget_link_libraries(client\\nmy_library::my_library)\\nsyntax.\\nament_export_targets\\ncan take an arbitrary list of targets named as\\nEXPORT\\nin an install call and an additional option\\nHAS_LIBRARY_TARGET\\n, which adds potential libraries to environment variables.\\nThe\\nament_export_dependencies\\nexports dependencies to downstream packages.\\nThis is necessary so that the user of the library does not have to call\\nfind_package\\nfor those dependencies, too.\\nThe first\\ninstall\\ncommands installs the header files which should be available to clients.\\nWarning\\nCalling\\nament_export_targets\\n,\\nament_export_dependencies\\n, or other ament commands from a CMake subdirectory will not work as expected.\\nThis is because the CMake subdirectory has no way of setting necessary variables in the parent scope where\\nament_package\\nis called.\\nThe last large install command installs the library.\\nArchive and library files will be exported to the lib folder, runtime binaries will be installed to the bin folder and the path to installed headers is\\ninclude\\n.\\nNote\\nWindows DLLs are treated as runtime artifacts and installed into the\\nRUNTIME\\nDESTINATION\\nfolder.\\nIt is therefore advised to not leave out the\\nRUNTIME\\ninstall even when developing libraries on Unix based systems.\\nRegarding the\\ninclude\\ndirectory\\n, the install command only adds information to CMake, it does not actually install the includes folder.\\nThis is done by copying the headers via\\ninstall(DIRECTORY\\n<dir>\\nDESTINATION\\n<dest>)\\nas described above.\\nThe\\nEXPORT\\nnotation of the install call requires additional attention:\\nIt installs the CMake files for the\\nmy_library\\ntarget.\\nIt is named exactly like the argument in\\nament_export_targets\\nand could be named like the library.\\nHowever, this will then prohibit using the\\nament_target_dependencies\\nway of including your library.\\nTo allow for full flexibility, it is advised to prepend the export target with something like\\n<target>Targets\\n.\\nAll install paths are relative to\\nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\\n, which is already set correctly by colcon/ament\\nThere are two additional functions which can be used but are superfluous for target based installs:\\nament_export_include_directories\\n(\\ninclude\\n)\\nament_export_libraries\\n(\\nmy_library\\n)\\nThe first macro marks the directory of the exported include directories (this is achieved by\\nINCLUDES\\nDESTINATION\\nin the target\\ninstall\\ncall).\\nThe second macro marks the location of the installed library (this is done by the\\nHAS_LIBRARY_TARGET\\nargument in the call to\\nament_export_targets\\n).\\nSome of the macros can take different types of arguments for non-target exports, but since the recommended way for modern Make is to use targets, we will not cover them here.\\nDocumentation of these options can be found in the source code itself.\\nCompiler and linker options\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 targets compilers which comply with the C++14 and C99 standard until at least\\nCrystal\\nClemmys\\n.\\nNewer versions might be targeted in the future and are referenced\\nhere\\n.\\nTherefore it is customary to set the corresponding CMake flags:\\nif\\n(\\nNOT\\nCMAKE_C_STANDARD\\n)\\nset\\n(\\nCMAKE_C_STANDARD\\n99\\n)\\nendif\\n()\\nif\\n(\\nNOT\\nCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD\\n)\\nset\\n(\\nCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD\\n14\\n)\\nendif\\n()\\nTo keep the code clean, compilers should throw warnings for questionable code and these warnings should be fixed.\\nIt is recommended to at least cover the following warning levels:\\nFor Visual Studio, the default\\nW1\\nwarnings are kept\\nFor GCC and Clang:\\n-Wall\\n-Wextra\\n-Wpedantic\\nare required and\\n-Wshadow\\n-Werror\\nare advisable (the latter makes warnings errors).\\nAlthough modern CMake advises to add compiler flags on a target basis, i.e. call\\ntarget_compile_options\\n(\\nmy_target\\nPRIVATE\\n-Wall\\n)\\nit is at the moment recommended to use the directory level function\\nadd_compile_options(-Wall)\\nto not clutter the code with target-based compile options for all executables and tests.\\nBuilding libraries on Windows\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSince Linux, Mac and Windows are all officially supported platforms, to have maximum impact any package should also build on Windows.\\nThe Windows library format enforces symbol visibility:\\nEvery symbol which should be used from a client has to be explicitly exported by the library (and data symbols need to be implicitly imported).\\nTo keep this compatible with Clang and GCC builds, it is advised to use the logic in\\nthe GCC wiki\\n.\\nTo use it for a package called\\nmy_library\\n:\\nCopy the logic in the link into a header file called\\nvisibility_control.hpp\\n.\\nReplace\\nDLL\\nby\\nMY_LIBRARY\\n(for an example, see visibility control of\\nrviz_rendering\\n).\\nUse the macros â\\x80\\x9cMY_LIBRARY_PUBLICâ\\x80\\x9d for all symbols you need to export (i.e. classes or functions).\\nIn the project\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nuse:\\ntarget_compile_definitions\\n(\\nmy_library\\nPRIVATE\\n\"MY_LIBRARY_BUILDING_LIBRARY\"\\n)\\nFor more details, see\\nWindows Symbol Visibility in the Windows Tips and Tricks document\\n.\\nTesting and Linting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn order to separate testing from building the library with colcon, wrap all calls to linters and tests in a conditional:\\nif\\n(\\nBUILD_TESTING\\n)\\nfind_package\\n(\\nament_cmake_gtest\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nament_add_gtest\\n(\\n<tests>\\n)\\nendif\\n()\\nLinting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s advised to use the combined call from\\nament_lint_auto\\n:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nament_lint_auto\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nament_lint_auto_find_test_dependencies\\n()\\nThis will run linters as defined in the\\npackage.xml\\n.\\nIt is recommended to use the set of linters defined by the package\\nament_lint_common\\n.\\nThe individual linters included there, as well as their functions, can be seen in the\\nament_lint_common docs\\n.\\nLinters provided by ament can also be added separately, instead of running\\nament_lint_auto\\n.\\nOne example of how to do so can be found in the\\nament_cmake_lint_cmake documentation\\n.\\nTesting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAment contains CMake macros to simplify setting up GTests. Call:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nament_cmake_gtest\\n)\\nament_add_gtest\\n(\\nsome_test\\n<test_sources>\\n)\\nto add a GTest.\\nThis is then a regular target which can be linked against other libraries (such as the project library).\\nThe macros have additional parameters:\\nAPPEND_ENV\\n: append environment variables.\\nFor instance you can add to the ament prefix path by calling:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nament_cmake_gtest\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nament_add_gtest\\n(\\nsome_test\\n<test_sources>\\nAPPEND_ENV\\nPATH=some/addtional/path/for/testing/resources\\n)\\nAPPEND_LIBRARY_DIRS\\n: append libraries so that they can be found by the linker at runtime.\\nThis can be achieved by setting environment variables like\\nPATH\\non Windows and\\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH\\non Linux, but this makes the call platform specific.\\nENV\\n: set environment variables (same syntax as\\nAPPEND_ENV\\n).\\nTIMEOUT\\n: set a test timeout in second. The default for GTests is 60 seconds.  For example:\\nament_add_gtest\\n(\\nsome_test\\n<test_sources>\\nTIMEOUT\\n120\\n)\\nSKIP_TEST\\n: skip this test (will be shown as â\\x80\\x9cpassedâ\\x80\\x9d in the console output).\\nSKIP_LINKING_MAIN_LIBRARIES\\n: Donâ\\x80\\x99t link against GTest.\\nWORKING_DIRECTORY\\n: set the working directory for the test.\\nThe default working directory otherwise is the\\nCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\\n, which is described in the\\nCMake documentation\\n.\\nSimilarly, there is a CMake macro to set up GTest including GMock:\\nfind_package\\n(\\nament_cmake_gmock\\nREQUIRED\\n)\\nament_add_gmock\\n(\\nsome_test\\n<test_sources>\\n)\\nIt has the same additional parameters as\\nament_add_gtest\\n.\\nExtending ament\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is possible to register additional macros/functions with\\nament_cmake\\nand extend it in several ways.\\nAdding a function/macro to ament\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nExtending ament will often times mean that you want to have some functions available to other packages.\\nThe best way to provide the macro to client packages is to register it with ament.\\nThis can be done by appending the\\n${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS\\nvariable, which is used by\\nament_package()\\nvia\\nlist\\n(\\nAPPEND\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\n_CONFIG_EXTRAS\\npath/to/file.cmake\\n\"\\nother/pathto/file.cmake\"\\n)\\nAlternatively, you can directly add the files to the\\nament_package()\\ncall:\\nament_package\\n(\\nCONFIG_EXTRAS\\npath/to/file.cmake\\nother/pathto/file.cmake\\n)\\nAdding to extension points\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn addition to simple files with functions that can be used in other packages, you can also add extensions to ament.\\nThose extensions are scripts which are executed with the function which defines the extension point.\\nThe most common use-case for ament extensions is probably registering rosidl message generators:\\nWhen writing a generator, you normally want to generate all messages and services with your generator also without modifying the code for the message/service definition packages.\\nThis is possible by registering the generator as an extension to\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n.\\nAs an example, see\\nament_register_extension\\n(\\n\"rosidl_generate_interfaces\"\\n\"rosidl_generator_cpp\"\\n\"rosidl_generator_cpp_generate_interfaces.cmake\"\\n)\\nwhich registers the macro\\nrosidl_generator_cpp_generate_interfaces.cmake\\nfor the package\\nrosidl_generator_cpp\\nto the extension point\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n.\\nWhen the extension point gets executed, this will trigger the execution of the script\\nrosidl_generator_cpp_generate_interfaces.cmake\\nhere.\\nIn particular, this will call the generator whenever the function\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\ngets executed.\\nThe most important extension point for generators, aside from\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n, is\\nament_package\\n, which will simply execute scripts with the\\nament_package()\\ncall.\\nThis extension point is useful when registering resources (see below).\\nament_register_extension\\nis a function which takes exactly three arguments:\\nextension_point\\n: The name of the extension point (most of the time this will be one of\\nament_package\\nor\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n)\\npackage_name\\n: The name of the package containing the CMake file (i.e. the project name of the project where the file is written to)\\ncmake_filename\\n: The CMake file executed when the extension point is run\\nNote\\nIt is possible to define custom extension points in a similar manner to\\nament_package\\nand\\nrosidl_generate_interfaces\\n, but this should hardly be necessary.\\nAdding extension points\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nVery rarely, it might be interesting to define a new extension point to ament.\\nExtension points can be registered within a macro so that all extensions will be executed when the corresponding macro is called.\\nTo do so:\\nDefine and document a name for your extension (e.g.\\nmy_extension_point\\n), which is the name passed to the\\nament_register_extension\\nmacro when using the extension point.\\nIn the macro/function which should execute the extensions call:\\nament_execute_extensions\\n(\\nmy_extension_point\\n)\\nAment extensions work by defining a variable containing the name of the extension point and filling it with the macros to be executed.\\nUpon calling\\nament_execute_extensions\\n, the scripts defined in the variable are then executed one after another.\\nAdding resources\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEspecially when developing plugins or packages which allow plugins it is often essential to add resources to one ROS package from another (e.g. a plugin).\\nExamples can be plugins for tools using the pluginlib.\\nThis can be achieved using the ament index (also called â\\x80\\x9cresource indexâ\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe ament index explained\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor details on the design and intentions, see\\nhere\\nIn principle, the ament index is contained in a folder within the install/share folder of your package.\\nIt contains shallow subfolders named after different types of resources.\\nWithin the subfolder, each package providing said resource is referenced by name with a â\\x80\\x9cmarker fileâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThe file may contain whatever content necessary to obtain the resources, e.g. relative paths to the installation directories of the resource, it may also be simply empty.\\nTo give an example, consider providing display plugins for RViz:\\nWhen providing RViz plugins in a project named\\nmy_rviz_displays\\nwhich will be read by the pluginlib, you will provide a\\nplugin_description.xml\\nfile, which will be installed and used by the pluginlib to load the plugins.\\nTo achieve this, the plugin_description.xml is registered as a resource in the resource_index via\\npluginlib_export_plugin_description_file\\n(\\nrviz_common\\nplugins_description.xml\\n)\\nWhen running\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n, this installs a file\\nmy_rviz_displays\\ninto a subfolder\\nrviz_common__pluginlib__plugin\\ninto the resource_index.\\nPluginlib factories within rviz_common will know to gather information from all folders named\\nrviz_common__pluginlib__plugin\\nfor packages that export plugins.\\nThe marker file for pluginlib factories contains an install-folder relative path to the\\nplugins_description.xml\\nfile (and the name of the library as marker file name).\\nWith this information, the pluginlib can load the library and know which plugins to load from the\\nplugin_description.xml\\nfile.\\nAs a second example, consider the possibility to let your own RViz plugins use your own custom meshes.\\nMeshes get loaded at startup time so that the plugin owner does not have to deal with it, but this implies RViz has to know about the meshes.\\nTo achieve this, RViz provides a function:\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports\\n(\\nDIRECTORIES\\n<my_dirs>\\n)\\nThis registers the directories as an ogre_media resource in the ament index.\\nIn short, it installs a file named after the project which calls the function into a subfolder called\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\n.\\nThe file contains the install folder relative paths to the directories listed in the macros.\\nOn startup time, RViz can now search for all folders called\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nand load resources in all folders provided.\\nThese searches are done using\\nament_index_cpp\\n(or\\nament_index_py\\nfor Python packages).\\nIn the following sections we will explore how to add your own resources to the ament index and provide best practices for doing so.\\nQuerying the ament index\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf necessary, it is possible to query the ament index for resources via CMake.\\nTo do so, there are three functions:\\nament_index_has_resource\\n: obtain a prefix path to the resource if it exists with the following parameters:\\nvar\\n: the output parameter: fill this variable with FALSE if the resource does not exist or the prefix path to the resource otherwise\\nresource_type\\n: The type of the resource (e.g.\\nrviz_common__pluginlib__plugin\\n)\\nresource_name\\n: The name of the resource which usually amounts to the name of the package having added the resource of type resource_type (e.g.\\nrviz_default_plugins\\n)\\nament_index_get_resource\\n: Obtain the content of a specific resource, i.e. the contents of the marker file in the ament index.\\nvar\\n: the output parameter: filled with the content of the resource marker file if it exists.\\nresource_type\\n: The type of the resource (e.g.\\nrviz_common__pluginlib__plugin\\n)\\nresource_name\\n: The name of the resource which usually amounts to the name of the package having added the resource of type resource_type (e.g.\\nrviz_default_plugins\\n)\\nPREFIX_PATH\\n: The prefix path to search for (usually, the default\\nament_index_get_prefix_path()\\nwill be enough).\\nNote that\\nament_index_get_resource\\nwill throw an error if the resource does not exist, so it might be necessary to check using\\nament_index_has_resource\\n.\\nament_index_get_resources\\n: Get all packages which registered resources of a specific type from the index\\nvar\\n: Output parameter: filled with a list of names of all packages which registered a resource of resource_type\\nresource_type\\n: The type of the resource (e.g.\\nrviz_common__pluginlib__plugin\\n)\\nPREFIX_PATH\\n: The prefix path to search for (usually, the default\\nament_index_get_prefix_path()\\nwill be enough).\\nAdding to the ament index\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDefining a resource requires two bits of information:\\na name for the resource which must be unique,\\na layout of the marker file, which can be anything and could also be empty (this is true for instance for the â\\x80\\x9cpackageâ\\x80\\x9d resource marking a ROS 2 package)\\nFor the RViz mesh resource, the corresponding choices were:\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nas name of the resource,\\ninstall path relative paths to all folders containing resources. This will already enable you to write the logic for using the corresponding resource in your package.\\nTo allow users to easily register resources for your package, you should furthermore provide macros or functions such as the pluginlib function or\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nfunction.\\nTo register a resource, use the ament function\\nament_index_register_resource\\n.\\nThis will create and install the marker files in the resource_index.\\nAs an example, the corresponding call for\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nis the following:\\nament_index_register_resource\\n(\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nCONTENT\\n${\\nOGRE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_FILE\\n}\\n)\\nThis installs a file named like\\n${PROJECT_NAME}\\ninto a folder\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\ninto the resource_index with content given by variable\\n${OGRE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_FILE}\\n.\\nThe macro has a number of parameters that can be useful:\\nthe first (unnamed) parameter is the name of the resource, which amounts to the name of the folder in the resource_index\\nCONTENT\\n: The content of the marker file as string. This could be a list of relative paths, etc.\\nCONTENT\\ncannot be used together with\\nCONTENT_FILE\\n.\\nCONTENT_FILE\\n: The path to a file which will be use to create the marker file. The file can be a plain file or a template file expanded with\\nconfigure_file()\\n.\\nCONTENT_FILE\\ncannot be used together with\\nCONTENT\\n.\\nPACKAGE_NAME\\n: The name of the package/library exporting the resource, which amounts to the name of the marker file. Defaults to\\n${PROJECT_NAME}\\n.\\nAMENT_INDEX_BINARY_DIR\\n: The base path of the generated ament index. Unless really necessary, always use the default\\n${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/ament_cmake_index\\n.\\nSKIP_INSTALL\\n: Skip installing the marker file.\\nSince only one marker file exists per package, it is usually a problem if the CMake function/macro gets called twice by the same project.\\nHowever, for large projects it might be best to split up calls registering resources.\\nTherefore, it is best practice to let a macro registering a resource such as\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports.cmake\\nonly fill some variables.\\nThe real call to\\nament_index_register_resource\\ncan then be added within an ament extension to\\nament_package\\n.\\nSince there must only ever be one call to\\nament_package\\nper project, there will always only be one place where the resource gets registered.\\nIn the case of\\nrviz_ogre_media_exports\\nthis amounts to the following strategy:\\nThe macro\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports\\ntakes a list of folders and appends them to a variable called\\nOGRE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_FILE\\n.\\nAnother macro called\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports_hook\\ncalls\\nament_index_register_resource\\nif\\n${OGRE_MEDIA_RESOURCE_FILE}\\nis non-empty.\\nThe\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports_hook.cmake\\nfile is registered as an ament extension in a third file\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports_hook-extras.cmake\\nvia calling\\nament_register_extension\\n(\\n\"ament_package\"\\n\"rviz_rendering\"\\n\"register_rviz_ogre_media_exports_hook.cmake\"\\n)\\nThe files\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports.cmake\\nand\\nregister_rviz_ogre_media_exports_hook-extra.cmake\\nare registered as\\nCONFIG_EXTRA\\nwith\\nament_package()\\n.'},\n",

visit\\nMigrating launch files from ROS 1 to ROS 2\\n.\\nFor most applications the choice of which ROS 2 launch format comes down to developer preference.\\nHowever, if your launch file requires flexibility that you cannot achieve with XML or YAML, you can use Python to write your launch file.\\nUsing Python for ROS 2 launch is more flexible because of following two reasons:\\nPython is a scripting language, and thus you can leverage the language and its libraries in your launch files.\\nros2/launch\\n(general launch features) and\\nros2/launch_ros\\n(ROS 2 specific launch features) are written in Python and thus you have lower level access to launch features that may not be exposed by XML and YAML.\\nThat being said, a launch file written in Python may be more complex and verbose than one in XML or YAML.'},\n",

calls\\n1.1 Sync deadlock\\n2 Asynchronous calls\\nSummary\\nIntroduction\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis guide is intended to warn users of the risks associated with the Python synchronous service client\\ncall()\\nAPI.\\nIt is very easy to mistakenly cause deadlock when calling services synchronously, so we do not recommend using\\ncall()\\n.\\nWe provide an example on how to use\\ncall()\\ncorrectly for experienced users who wish to use synchronous calls and are aware of the pitfalls.\\nWe also highlight possible scenarios for deadlock that accompany it.\\nBecause we recommend avoiding sync calls, this guide will also address the features and usage of the recommended alternative, async calls (\\ncall_async()\\n).\\nThe C++ service call API is only available in async, so the comparisons and examples in this guide pertain to Python services and clients.\\nThe definition of async given here generally applies to C++, with some exceptions.\\n1 Synchronous calls\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA synchronous client will block the calling thread when sending a request to a service until a response has been received; nothing else can happen on that thread during the call.\\nThe call can take arbitrary amounts of time to complete.\\nOnce complete, the response returns directly to the client.\\nThe following is an example of how to correctly execute a synchronous service call from a client node, similar to the async node in the\\nSimple Service and Client\\ntutorial.\\nimport\\nsys\\nfrom\\nthreading\\nimport\\nThread\\nfrom\\nexample_interfaces.srv\\nimport\\nAddTwoInts\\nimport\\nrclpy\\nfrom\\nrclpy.node\\nimport\\nNode\\nclass\\nMinimalClientSync\\n(\\nNode\\n):\\ndef\\n__init__\\n(\\nself\\n):\\nsuper\\n()\\n.\\n__init__\\n(\\n'minimal_client_sync'\\n)\\nself\\n.\\ncli\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_client\\n(\\nAddTwoInts\\n,\\n'add_two_ints'\\n)\\nwhile\\nnot\\nself\\n.\\ncli\\n.\\nwait_for_service\\n(\\ntimeout_sec\\n=\\n1.0\\n):\\nself\\n.\\nget_logger\\n()\\n.\\ninfo\\n(\\n'service

deadlock\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are several ways that the synchronous\\ncall()\\nAPI can cause deadlock.\\nAs mentioned in the comments of the example above, failing to create a separate thread to spin\\nrclpy\\nis one cause of deadlock.\\nWhen a client is blocking a thread waiting for a response, but the response can only be returned on that same thread, the client will never stop waiting, and nothing else can happen.\\nAnother cause of deadlock is blocking\\nrclpy.spin\\nby calling a service synchronously in a subscription, timer callback or service callback.\\nFor example, if the synchronous clientâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsend_request\\nis placed in a callback:\\ndef\\ntrigger_request\\n(\\nmsg\\n):\\nresponse\\n=\\nminimal_client\\n.\\nsend_request\\n()\\n# This will cause deadlock\\nminimal_client\\n.\\nget_logger\\n()\\n.\\ninfo\\n(\\n'Result of add_two_ints:

occurs because\\nrclpy.spin\\nwill not preempt the callback with the\\nsend_request\\ncall.\\nIn general, callbacks should only perform light and fast operations.\\nWarning\\nWhen deadlock occurs, you will not receive any indication that the service is blocked.\\nThere will be no warning or exception thrown, no indication in the stack trace, and the call will not fail.\\n2 Asynchronous calls\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAsync calls in\\nrclpy\\nare entirely safe and the recommended method of calling services.\\nThey can be made from anywhere without running the risk of blocking other ROS and non-ROS processes, unlike sync calls.\\nAn asynchronous client will immediately return\\nfuture\\n, a value that indicates whether the call and response is finished (not the value of the response itself), after sending a request to a service.\\nThe returned\\nfuture\\nmay be queried for a response at any time.\\nSince sending a request doesnâ\\x80\\x99t block anything, a loop can be used to both spin\\nrclpy\\nand check\\nfuture\\nin the same thread, for example:\\nwhile\\nrclpy\\n.\\nok\\n():\\nrclpy\\n.\\nspin_once\\n(\\nnode\\n)\\nif\\nfuture\\n.\\ndone\\n():\\n#Get response\\nThe\\nSimple Service and Client\\ntutorial for Python illustrates how to perform an async service call and retrieve the\\nfuture\\nusing a loop.\\nThe\\nfuture\\ncan also be retrieved using a timer or callback, like in\\nthis example\\n, a dedicated thread, or by another method.\\nIt is up to you, as the caller, to decide how to store\\nfuture\\n, check on its status, and retrieve your response.\\nSummary\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIt is not recommended to implement a synchronous service client.\\nThey are susceptible to deadlock, but will not provide any indication of issue when deadlock occurs.\\nIf you must use synchronous calls, the example in section\\n1 Synchronous calls\\nis a safe method of doing so.\\nYou should also be aware of the conditions that cause deadlock outlined in section\\n1.1 Sync deadlock\\n.\\nWe recommend using async service clients instead.\"},\n",

(128 MB)\\nSignificantly increasing this parameterâ\\x80\\x99s value is an attempt to ensure that the buffer never becomes completely full.\\nHowever, the value would likely have to be significantly high to hold all data received during the time window of\\nipfrag_time\\n, assuming every UDP packet lacks one fragment.\\nIssue:\\nSending custom messages with large variable-sized arrays of non-primitive types causes high serialization/deserialization overhead and CPU load.\\nThis can lead to stalling of the publisher due to excessive time spent in\\npublish()\\nand tools like\\nros2\\ntopic\\nhz\\nunder reporting the actual frequency of messages being received.\\nNote that for example\\nbuiltin_interfaces/Time\\nis also considered a non-primitive type and will incur higher serialization overhead.\\nBecause of the increased serialization overhead, severe performance degradation can be observed when naively transitioning custom message types from ROS 1 to ROS 2.\\nWorkaround:\\nUse multiple arrays of primitives instead of a single array of custom types, or pack into byte array as done e.g. in\\nPointCloud2\\nmessages.\\nFor example, instead of defining a\\nFooArray\\nmessage as:\\nFoo[] my_large_array\\nwith\\nFoo\\nis defined as:\\nuint64 foo_1\\nuint32 foo_2\\nInstead, define\\nFooArray\\nas:\\nuint64[] foo_1_array\\nuint32[] foo_2_array\\nFast RTPS tuning\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIssue:\\nFast RTPS floods the network with large pieces of data or fast-published data when operating over WiFi.\\nSee the solutions under\\nCross-vendor tuning\\n.\\nCyclone DDS tuning\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIssue:\\nCyclone DDS is not delivering large messages reliably, despite using reliable settings and transferring over a wired network.\\nThis issue should be\\naddressed soon\\n.\\nUntil then, weâ\\x80\\x99ve come up with the following solution (debugged using\\nthis test program\\n):\\nSolution:\\nIncrease the maximum Linux kernel receive buffer size and the minimum socket receive buffer size that Cyclone uses.\\nAdjustments to solve for a 9MB message:\\nSet the maximum receive buffer size,\\nrmem_max\\n, by running:\\nsudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647\\nOr permanently set it by editing the\\n/etc/sysctl.d/10-cyclone-max.conf\\nfile to contain:\\nnet.core.rmem_max=2147483647\\nNext, to set the minimum socket receive buffer size that Cyclone requests, write out a configuration file for Cyclone to use while starting, like so:\\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\\n<CycloneDDS\\nxmlns=\\n\"https://cdds.io/config\"\\nxmlns:xsi=\\n\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\\nxsi:schemaLocation=\\n\"https://cdds.io/config\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/master/etc/cyclonedds.xsd\"\\n>\\n<Domain\\nid=\\n\"any\"\\n>\\n<Internal>\\n<MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize>\\n10MB\\n</MinimumSocketReceiveBufferSize>\\n</Internal>\\n</Domain>\\n</CycloneDDS>\\nThen, whenever you are going to run a node, set the following environment variable:\\nCYCLONEDDS_URI=file:///absolute/path/to/config_file.xml\\nRTI Connext tuning\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIssue:\\nConnext is not delivering large messages reliably, despite using reliable settings and transferring over a wired network.\\nSolution:\\nThis\\nConnext QoS profile\\n, along with increasing the\\nrmem_max\\nparameter.\\nSet the maximum receive buffer size,\\nrmem_max\\n, by running:\\nsudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=4194304\\nBy tuning\\nnet.core.rmem_max\\nto 4MB in the Linux kernel, the QoS profile can produce truly reliable behavior.\\nThis configuration has been proven to reliably deliver messages via SHMEM|UDPv4, and with just UDPv4 on a single machine.\\nA multi-machine configuration was also tested with\\nrmem_max\\nat 4MB and at 20MB (two machines connected with 1Gbps ethernet), with no dropped messages and average message delivery times of 700ms and 371ms, respectively.\\nWithout configuring the kernelâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrmem_max\\n, the same Connext QoS profile took up to 12 seconds for the data to be delivered.\\nHowever, it always at least managed to complete the delivery.\\nSolution:\\nUse the\\nConnext QoS profile\\nwithout\\nadjusting\\nrmem_max\\n.\\nThe ROS2TEST_QOS_PROFILES.xml file was configured using RTIâ\\x80\\x99s documentation on\\nconfiguring flow controllers\\n.

See\\nInstall DDS implementations\\n.\\nBoth C++ and Python nodes support an environment variable\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\nthat allows the user to select the RMW implementation to use when running ROS 2 applications.\\nThe user may set this variable to a specific implementation identifier, such as\\nrmw_cyclonedds_cpp\\n,\\nrmw_fastrtps_cpp\\n,\\nrmw_connextdds\\n, or\\nrmw_gurumdds_cpp\\n.\\nFor example, to run the talker demo using the C++ talker and Python listener with the Connext RMW implementation:\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\ntalker\\n# Run in another terminal\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_py\\nlistener\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\ntalker\\n# Run in another terminal\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_py\\nlistener\\nset\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\\nREM run in another terminal\\nset\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2 run demo_nodes_py listener\\nAdding RMW implementations to your workspace\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSuppose that you have built your ROS 2 workspace with only Cyclone DDS installed and therefore only the Cyclone DDS RMW implementation built.\\nThe last time your workspace was built, any other RMW implementation packages,\\nrmw_connextdds\\nfor example, were probably unable to find installations of the relevant DDS implementations.\\nIf you then install an additional DDS implementation, Connext for example, you will need to re-trigger the check for a Connext installation that occurs when the Connext RMW implementation is being built.\\nYou can do this by specifying the\\n--cmake-force-configure\\nflag on your next workspace build, and you should see that the RMW implementation package then gets built for the newly installed DDS implementation.\\nIt is possible to run into a problem when â\\x80\\x9crebuildingâ\\x80\\x9d the workspace with an additional RMW implementation using the\\n--cmake-force-configure\\noption where the build complains about the default RMW implementation changing.\\nTo resolve this, you can either set the default implementation to what is was before with the\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\nCMake argument or you can delete the build folder for packages that complain and continue the build with\\n--start-with\\n<package\\nname>\\n.\\nTroubleshooting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEnsuring use of a particular RMW implementation\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf the\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\nenvironment variable is set to an RMW implementation for which support is not installed, you will see an error message similar to the following if you have only one implementation installed:\\nExpected\\nRMW\\nimplementation\\nidentifier\\nof\\n'rmw_connextdds'\\nbut\\ninstead\\nfound\\n'rmw_fastrtps_cpp'\\n,\\nexiting\\nwith\\n102\\n.\\nIf you have support for multiple RMW implementations installed and you request use of one that is not installed, you will see something similar to:\\nError\\ngetting\\nRMW\\nimplementation\\nidentifier\\n/\\nRMW\\nimplementation\\nnot\\ninstalled\\n(\\nexpected\\nidentifier\\nof\\n'rmw_connextdds'\\n)\\n,\\nexiting\\nwith\\n1\\n.\\nIf this occurs, double check that your ROS 2 installation includes support for the RMW implementation that you have specified in the\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\nenvironment variable.\\nIf you want to switch between RMW implementations, verify that the ROS 2 daemon process is not running with the previous RMW implementation to avoid any issues between nodes and command line tools such as\\nros2\\nnode\\n.\\nFor example, if you run:\\nRMW_IMPLEMENTATION\\n=\\nrmw_connextdds\\nros2\\nrun\\ndemo_nodes_cpp\\ntalker\\nand\\nros2\\nnode\\nlist\\nit will generate a daemon with a Cyclone DDS implementation:\\n21318\\n22\\n.0\\n0\\n.6\\n535896\\n55044\\npts/8\\nSl\\n16\\n:14\\n0\\n:00\\n/usr/bin/python3\\n/opt/ros/galactic/bin/_ros2_daemon\\n--rmw-implementation\\nrmw_cyclonedds_cpp\\n--ros-domain-id\\n22\\nEven if you run the command line tool again with the correct RMW implementation, the daemonâ\\x80\\x99s RMW implementation will not change and the ROS 2 command line tools will fail.\\nTo solve this, simply stop the daemon process:\\nros2\\ndaemon\\nstop\\nand rerun the ROS 2 command line tool with the correct RMW implementation.\\nRTI Connext on OSX: Failure due to insufficient shared memory kernel settings\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf you receive an error message similar to below when running RTI Connext on OSX:\\n[D0062|ENABLE]DDS_DomainParticipantPresentation_reserve_participant_index_entryports:!enable reserve participant index\\n[D0062|ENABLE]DDS_DomainParticipant_reserve_participant_index_entryports:Unusable shared memory transport.

For all other purposes, follow the\\ncross_compile\\npackage documentation.\\nAlthough ROS 2 is a rich software stack with a number of dependencies, it primarily uses two different types of packages:\\nPython based software, which requires no cross-compilation.\\nCMake based software, which provides a mechanism to do cross-compilation.\\nFurthermore, the ROS 2 software stack is built with\\nColcon\\nwhich provides a mechanism to forward parameters to the CMake instance used for the individual build of each package/library that is part of the ROS 2 distribution.\\nWhen building ROS 2 natively, the developer is required to download all the dependencies (e.g. Python and other libraries) before compiling the packages that are part of the ROS 2 distribution. When cross-compiling, the same approach is required. The developer must first have the target systemâ\\x80\\x99s filesystem with all dependencies already installed.\\nThe next sections of this document explain in detail the use of\\ncmake-toolchains\\nand the\\nCMAKE_SYSROOT\\nfeature to cross-compile ROS 2.\\nCMake toolchain-file\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA CMake toolchain-file is a file which defines variables to configure CMake for cross-compilation. The basic entries are:\\nCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME\\n: the target platform, e.g.\\nlinux\\nCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR\\n: the target architecture, e.g.\\naarch64\\nor\\narm\\nCMAKE_SYSROOT\\n: the path to the target file-system\\nCMAKE_C_COMPILER\\n: the C cross-compiler, e.g.\\naarch64-linux-gnu-gcc\\nCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER\\n: the C++ cross-compiler, e.g.\\naarch64-linux-gnu-g++\\nCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\\n: an alternative path used by the\\nfind_*\\ncommand to find the file-system\\nWhen cross-compiling ROS 2, the following options are required to be set:\\nCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH\\n: the alternative path used by the\\nfind_*\\ncommand, use it to specify the path to ROS 2\\n/install\\nfolder\\nCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*\\n: the search strategy for program,package,library, and include, usually:\\nNEVER\\n(look on the host-fs),\\nONLY\\n(look on sysroot), and\\nBOTH\\n(look on both sysroot and host-fs)\\nPYTHON_SOABI\\n: the index name of the python libraries generated by ROS 2, e.g.\\ncpython-36m-aarch64-linux-gnu\\nTHREADS_PTHREAD_ARG\\n\"0\"\\nCACHE\\nSTRING\\n\"Result\\nfrom\\nTRY_RUN\"\\nFORCE\\n: Force the result of the\\nTRY_RUN\\ncmd to 0 (success) because binaries can not run on the host system.\\nThe toolchain-file is provided to CMake with the\\n-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/file\\nparameter. This will also set the\\nCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING\\nvariable to\\ntrue\\nwhich can be used by the software being built.\\nThe\\nCMAKE_SYSROOT\\nis particularly important for ROS 2 as the packages need many dependencies (e.g. python, openssl, opencv, poco, eigen3, â\\x80¦).\\nSetting\\nCMAKE_SYSROOT\\nto a target file-system with all the dependencies installed on it will allow CMake to find them during the cross-compilation.\\nNote\\nYou can find more information on the CMake\\ndocumentation\\npage.\\nWhen downloading the ROS 2 source code, a generic toolchain-file is available in the repository\\nros-tooling/cross_compile/cmake-toolchains\\nwhich can be downloaded separately. Further examples on using it can be found on the\\nCross-compiling examples for Arm\\nsection.\\nTarget file-system\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs mentioned previously, ROS 2 requires different libraries which needs to be provided to cross-compile.\\nThere are a number of ways to obtain the file-system:\\ndownloading a pre-built image\\ninstalling the dependencies on the target and exporting the file-system (e.g. with sshfs)\\nusing qemu + docker (or chroot) to generate the file-system on the host machine.\\nNote\\nYou can find information on how to use Docker + qemu on the next\\nCross-compiling examples for Arm\\nsection.\\nBuild process\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe build process is similar to native compilation. The only difference is an extra argument to\\nColcon\\nto specify the\\ntoolchain-file\\n:\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n--merge-install\\n\\\\\\n--cmake-force-configure\\n\\\\\\n--cmake-args\\n\\\\\\n-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\\n=\\n\"<path_to_toolchain/toolchainfile.cmake>\"\\nThe\\ntoolchain-file\\nprovide to CMake the information of the\\ncross-compiler\\nand the\\ntarget\\nfile-system\\n.\\nColcon\\nwill call CMake with the given toolchain-file on every package of ROS 2.\\nCross-compiling examples for Arm\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAfter\\ndownloading the ROS 2 source code\\n, you can add cross-compilation assets to the workspace via\\ngit\\nclone\\nhttps://github.com/ros-tooling/cross_compile.git\\n-b\\n0.0.1\\nsrc/ros2/cross_compile\\n. These are working examples on how to cross-compile for Arm cores.\\nThe following targets are supported:\\nUbuntu-arm64: To be used with any ARMv8-A based system.\\nUbuntu-armhf: To be used with any modern ARMv7-A based system.\\nThese are the main steps:\\nInstalling development tools\\nDownloading ROS 2 source code\\nDownloading the ROS 2 cross-compilation assets\\nPreparing the sysroot\\nCross-compiling the ROS 2 software stack\\nThe next sections explains in detail each of these steps.\\nFor a quick-setup, have a look at the\\nAutomated Cross-compilation\\n.\\nNote\\nThese steps were tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)\\n1. Install development tools\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis step is similar to when building natively. The difference is that some of the libraries and tools are not required because they will be in the sysroot instead.\\nThe following packages are required\\nsudo\\napt\\nupdate\\n&&\\nsudo\\napt\\ninstall\\n-y\\n\\\\\\ncmake\\n\\\\\\ngit\\n\\\\\\nwget\\n\\\\\\npython3-pip\\n\\\\\\nqemu-user-static\\n\\\\\\ng++-aarch64-linux-gnu\\n\\\\\\ng++-arm-linux-gnueabihf\\n\\\\\\npkg-config-aarch64-linux-gnu\\n\\npython3\\n-m\\npip\\ninstall\\n-U\\n\\\\\\nvcstool\\n\\\\\\ncolcon-common-extensions\\nNote\\nYou can install vcstool and colcon-common-extensions via pip.

of the package.\\nThis guide gives some information about the responsibilities of a ROS 2 core package maintainer.\\nTable of Contents\\nReviews\\nContinuous Integration\\nPR builds

package\\nCorrect code\\nConforms to developer guidelines:\\nDeveloper Guide\\nCode Style Guide\\nAdds tests for the bug/feature\\nAdds documentation for new features\\nClean Continuous Integration run\\nTargets default branch (usually â\\x80\\x9crollingâ\\x80\\x9d)\\nHas at least one approval from a maintainer that is not the author\\nContinuous Integration\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll incoming code to ROS 2 core repositories must be run through Continuous Integration.\\nROS 2 currently has two separate CI systems, and it is required that PRs pass both of them before merging.\\nPR builds (\\nhttps://build.ros2.org/view/Rpr\\n)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 PR (Pull Request) builds run automatically every time a pull request is opened.\\nThese builds run a build and test of this package, and this package only.\\nThis means that it does not build any dependencies, and it also does not build any packages that depend upon this package.\\nThese builds are good for quick feedback to see if the change passes linters, unit tests, etc.\\nThere are two major problems with them:\\nThese builds do not work across multiple repositories (so wonâ\\x80\\x99t work for adding or changing an API, etc)\\nThese tests only run on Linux (they wonâ\\x80\\x99t run on macOS or Windows)\\nTo address these two problems, there is also the CI builds.\\nCI builds (\\nhttps://ci.ros2.org\\n)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nCI builds do not run automatically when a pull request is opened.\\nOne of the maintainers of the package must manually request that a CI build is done by going to\\nhttps://ci.ros2.org/job/ci_launcher/\\n.\\nBy default, running a job in this way will build and run tests for all packages (> 300 currently) on all platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows).\\nAs a full run can take many hours and tie up the CI machines, it is recommended that all runs here restrict the number of packages that are built and tested.\\nThis can be accomplished by using the colcon arguments\\n--packages-up-to\\n,\\n--packages-select\\n,\\n--packages-above-and-dependencies\\n,\\n--packages-above\\n, amongst others.\\nSee the\\ncolcon documentation\\nfor more examples on the flags that can be used.\\nFurther documentation on how to use the CI machinery is available at\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/ci/blob/master/CI_BUILDERS.md\\n.\\nMerging Pull Requests\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA pull request can be merged if all of the following are true:\\nThe DCO bot reports a passing result\\nThe PR build reports a passing result\\nThe CI build reports a passing result on all platforms\\nThe code has been reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer\\nAfter a PR is merged, it will automatically get built with the next\\nnightlies\\n.\\nIt is highly recommended to check the nightlies after merging pull requests to ensure no regressions have occurred.\\nKeeping CI green\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe nightly jobs that run tests are typically much more comprehensive than what is done for individual pull requests.\\nFor this reason, there can be regressions that occur in the nightlies that were not seen in the CI jobs.\\nIt is a package maintainers responsibility to check for regressions in their packages at the following locations:\\nhttps://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly\\nhttps://ci.ros2.org/view/packaging\\nhttps://build.ros2.org/view/Rci\\nhttps://build.ros2.org/view/Rdev\\nFor any problems that are found, new issues and/or pull requests on the relevant repositories should be opened.\\nMaking releases\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn order to get new features and bugfixes out to end users, the package maintainers must periodically do a release of the package (a release may also be requested on-demand from other maintainers).\\nA release in ROS terms consists of two distinct steps: making a source release, and then making a binary release.\\nSource release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA source release creates a changelog and a tag in the relevant repository.\\nThe process starts by generating or updating CHANGELOG.rst files with the following command:\\n$\\ncatkin_generate_changelog\\nIf one or more packages in the repository donâ\\x80\\x99t have contain CHANGELOG.rst, add the\\n--all\\noption to populate all of the previous commits for each package.\\nThe\\ncatkin_generate_changelog\\ncommand will simply populate the files with the commit logs from the repository.\\nSince those commit logs arenâ\\x80\\x99t always appropriate for a changelog, it is recommended to edit CHANGELOG.rst and edit it to make it more readable.\\nOnce editing is done, it is important to commit the updated CHANGELOG.rst file to the repository.\\nThe next step is to bump the version in the package.xml and the changelog files with the following command:\\n$\\ncatkin_prepare_release\\nThis command will find all of the packages in the repository, check that the changelogs exist, check that there are no uncommitted local changes, increment the version in the package.xml files, and commit/tag the changes with a bloom-compatible tag.\\nUsing this command is the best way to ensure the release versions are consistent and compatible with bloom.\\nBy default,\\ncatkin_prepare_release\\nwill bump the patch version of the packages, e.g. 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2 .\\nHowever, it can also bump the minor or major number, or even have an exact version set.\\nSee the help output from\\ncatkin_prepare_release\\nfor more information.\\nAssuming the above was successful, a source release has been made.\\nBinary release\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe next step is to use the\\nbloom-release\\ncommand to create a binary release.\\nFor full instructions on how to use bloom, please see\\nhttp://wiki.ros.org/bloom\\n.\\nTo do a binary release of a package, run:\\n$\\nbloom-release\\n--track\\n<rosdistro>\\n--rosdistro\\n<rosdistro>\\n<repository_name>\\nFor instance, to release the\\nrclcpp\\nrepository to the Galactic distribution, the command would be:\\n$\\nbloom-release\\n--track\\ngalactic\\n--rosdistro\\ngalactic\\nrclcpp\\nThis command will fetch the release repository, make the necessary changes to make the release, push the changes to the release repository, and finally open a pull request to\\nhttps://github.com/ros/rosdistro\\n.\\nBackporting to released distributions\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll incoming changes should first land on the development branch.\\nOnce a change has been merged onto the development branch, it can be considered for backporting to released distributions.\\nHowever, any backported code must not break\\nAPI\\nor\\nABI\\nin a released distribution.\\nIf a change can be backported without breaking API or ABI, then a new pull request targeting the appropriate branch should be created.\\nThe new pull request should be added to the appropriate distributions project board at\\nhttps://github.com/orgs/ros2/projects\\n.\\nThe new pull request should have all of the steps run as before, but making sure to target the distribution in question for CI, etc.\\nResponding to issues\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nPackage maintainers should also look at incoming issues on the repository and triage the problems that users are having.\\nFor issues that look like questions, the issue should be closed and the user redirected to\\nhttps://answers.ros.org\\n.\\nIf an issue looks like a problem, but is not relevant to this particular repository, it should be moved to the appropriate repository with the GitHub â\\x80\\x9cTransfer issueâ\\x80\\x9d button.\\nIf the reporter has not provided enough information to determine the cause of the problem, more information should be requested from the reporter.\\nIf this is a new feature, tag the issue with â\\x80\\x9chelp-wantedâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nAny remaining issues should be reproduced, and determined if they are truly a bug.\\nIf it is a bug, fixes are highly appreciated.\\nGetting help\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhile doing maintenance on a package, questions about general procedures or individual issues may come up.\\nFor general questions, please follow the\\ncontributing guidelines\\n.\\nFor questions on individual issues, please tag the ROS 2 GitHub team (@ros/team), and someone on the team will take a look.\"},\n",

controlling the execution of different callbacks.\\nThis page is meant as a guide on how to use callback groups efficiently.\\nIt is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding\\nabout the

callback groups\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen running a node in a Multi-Threaded Executor,\\nROS 2 offers two different types of callback groups for controlling\\nexecution of callbacks:\\nMutually Exclusive Callback Group\\nReentrant Callback Group\\nThese callback groups restrict the execution of their callbacks in\\ndifferent ways.\\nIn short:\\nMutually Exclusive Callback Group prevents its callbacks from being\\nexecuted in parallel - essentially making it as if the callbacks in the group\\nwere executed by a SingleThreadedExecutor.\\nReentrant Callback Group allows the executor to schedule and execute\\nthe groupâ\\x80\\x99s callbacks in any way the it sees fit, without restrictions.\\nThis means that, in addition to different callbacks being run parallel\\nto each other, different instances of the same callback may also be\\nexecuted concurrently.\\nCallbacks belonging to different callback groups (of any type) can always\\nbe executed parallel to each other.\\nIt is also important to keep in mind that different ROS 2 entities relay\\ntheir callback group to all callbacks they spawn.\\nFor example, if one assigns a callback group to an action client,\\nall callbacks created by the client will be assigned to that callback group.\\nCallback groups can be created by a nodeâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncreate_callback_group\\nfunction in rclcpp and by calling the constructor of the group in rclpy.\\nThe callback group can then be passed as argument/option when creating a subscription, timer, etc.\\nC++\\nPython\\nmy_callback_group\\n=\\ncreate_callback_group\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nCallbackGroupType\\n::\\nMutuallyExclusive\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSubscriptionOptions\\noptions\\n;\\noptions\\n.\\ncallback_group\\n=\\nmy_callback_group\\n;\\nmy_subscription\\n=\\ncreate_subscription\\n<\\nInt32\\n>\\n(\\n\"/topic\"\\n,\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSensorDataQoS\\n(),\\ncallback\\n,\\noptions\\n);\\nmy_callback_group\\n=\\nMutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup\\n()\\nmy_subscription\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nInt32\\n,\\n\"/topic\"\\n,\\nself\\n.\\ncallback\\n,\\nqos_profile\\n=\\n1\\n,\\ncallback_group\\n=\\nmy_callback_group\\n)\\nIf the user does not specify any callback group when creating a subscription,\\ntimer, etc., this entity will be assigned to the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s default callback group.\\nThe default callback group is a Mutually Exclusive Callback Group and it can be\\nqueried via\\nNodeBaseInterface::get_default_callback_group()\\nin rclcpp and\\nvia\\nNode.default_callback_group\\nin rclpy.\\nAbout callbacks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn the context of ROS 2 and executors, a callback means a function whose\\nscheduling and execution is handled by an executor.\\nExamples of callbacks in this context are\\nsubscription callbacks (receiving and handling data from a topic),\\ntimer callbacks,\\nservice callbacks (for executing service requests in a server),\\ndifferent callbacks in action servers and clients,\\ndone-callbacks of Futures.\\nBelow are a couple important points about callbacks that should be kept\\nin mind when working with callback groups.\\nAlmost everything in ROS 2 is a callback!\\nEvery function that is run by an executor is, by definition, a callback.\\nThe non-callback functions in a ROS 2 system are found mainly at\\nthe edge of the system (user and sensor inputs etc).\\nSometimes the callbacks are hidden and their presence may not be obvious\\nfrom the user/developer API.\\nThis is the case especially with any kind of â\\x80\\x9csynchronousâ\\x80\\x9d call to a\\nservice or an action (in rclpy).\\nFor example, the synchronous call\\nClient.call(request)\\nto a service\\nadds a Futureâ\\x80\\x99s done-callback that needs to be executed during the\\nexecution of the function call, but this callback is not directly\\nvisible to the user.\\nControlling execution\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn order to control execution with callback groups, one can consider the\\nfollowing guidelines.\\nRegister callbacks that should never be executed in parallel to the same\\nMutually Exclusive Callback Group.\\nAn example case might be that the callbacks are accessing shared\\ncritical and non-thread-safe resources.\\nIf you have a callback whose execution instances need to be able to overlap\\nwith each other, register it to a Reentrant Callback Group.\\nAn example case could be an action server that needs to be able to process\\nseveral action calls in parallel to each other.\\nIf you have different callbacks that require to be potentially executed\\nin parallel to one another, register them to\\na Reentrant Callback Group, or\\ndifferent Mutually Exclusive Callback Groups (this option is good if you\\nwant the callbacks to not overlap themselves or also need thread\\nsafety with respect to some other callbacks)\\nor different callback groups of any type (choose the types according\\nto other criteria).\\nNote that the option in the list is a valid way of allowing parallel\\nexecution for different callbacks, and can even be more desirable than simply\\nregistering everything into one Reentrant Callback Group.\\nAvoiding deadlocks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSetting up callback groups of a node incorrectly can lead to deadlocks (or\\nother unwanted behavior), especially if one desires to use synchronous calls to\\nservices or actions.\\nIndeed, even the API documentation of ROS 2 mentions that\\nsynchronous calls to actions or services should not be done in callbacks,\\nbecause it can lead to deadlocks.\\nWhile using asynchronous calls is indeed safer in this regard, synchronous\\ncalls can also be made to work.\\nOn the other hand, synchronous calls also have their advantages, such as\\nmaking the code simpler and easier to understand.\\nHence, this section provides some guidelines on how to set up a nodeâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncallback groups correctly in order to avoid deadlocks.\\nFirst thing to note here is that every nodeâ\\x80\\x99s default callback group is a\\nMutually Exclusive Callback Group.\\nIf the user does not specify any other callback group when creating a timer,\\nsubscription, client etc., any callbacks created then or later by these\\nentities will use the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s default callback group.\\nFurthermore, if everything in a node uses the same Mutually Exclusive\\nCallback Group, that node essentially acts as if it was handled\\nby a Single-Threaded Executor, even if a multi-threaded one is specified!\\nThus, whenever one decides to use a Multi-Threaded Executor,\\nsome callback group(s) should always be specified in order for the\\nexecutor choice to make sense.\\nWith the above in mind, here are a couple guidelines to help avoid deadlocks:\\nIf you make a synchronous call in any type of a callback, this callback and\\nthe client making the call need to belong to\\ndifferent callback groups (of any type), or\\na Reentrant Callback Group.\\nIf the above configuration is not possible due to other requirements - such\\nas thread-safety and/or blocking of other callbacks while waiting for the\\nresult (or if you want to make absolutely sure that there is never a\\npossibility of a deadlock), use asynchronous calls.\\nFailing the first point will always cause a deadlock.\\nAn example of such a case would be making a synchronous service call\\nin a timer callback (see the next section for an example).\\nExamples\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLet us look at some simple examples of different callback group setups.\\nThe following demo code considers calling a service synchronously in a timer\\ncallback.\\nDemo code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe have two nodes - one providing a simple

problem\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSince we are making service calls with a 1 second timer, the\\nexpected outcome is that the service gets called once a second,\\nthe client always gets a response and prints\\nReceived\\nresponse\\n.\\nIf we try running the server and client nodes\\nin terminals, we get the following outputs.\\nClient\\nServer\\n[INFO] [1653034371.758739131] [client_node]: Starting

[service_node]: Keyboard interrupt, shutting down.\\nSo, it turns out that instead of the service being called repeatedly,\\nthe response of the first call is never received, after which the\\nclient node seemingly gets stuck and does not make further calls.\\nThat is, the execution stopped at a deadlock!\\nThe reason for this is that the timer callback and the client are\\nusing the same Mutually Exclusive Callback Group (the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s default).\\nWhen the service call is made, the client then passes its callback\\ngroup to the Future object (hidden inside the call-method in the\\nPython version) whose done-callback needs to execute for the result\\nof the service call to be available.\\nBut because this done-callback and the timer callback are in the\\nsame Mutually Exclusive group and the timer callback is still\\nexecuting (waiting for the result of the service call),\\nthe done-callback never gets to execute.\\nThe stuck timer callback also blocks any other executions of itself, so the\\ntimer does not fire for a second time.\\nSolution\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe can fix this easily - for example - by assigning the timer and client\\nto different callback groups.\\nThus, let us change the first two lines of the client nodeâ\\x80\\x99s constructor\\nto be as follows (everything else shall stay the same):\\nC++\\nPython\\nclient_cb_group_\\n=\\nthis\\n->\\ncreate_callback_group\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nCallbackGroupType\\n::\\nMutuallyExclusive\\n);\\ntimer_cb_group_\\n=\\nthis\\n->\\ncreate_callback_group\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nCallbackGroupType\\n::\\nMutuallyExclusive\\n);\\nclient_cb_group\\n=\\nMutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup\\n()\\ntimer_cb_group\\n=\\nMutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup\\n()\\nNow

that implements common functionality needed for the ROS APIs of different languages.\\nThis makes it so that language-specific client libraries are easier to write and that they have more consistent behavior.\\nThe following client libraries are maintained by the ROS 2 team:\\nrclcpp = C++ client library\\nrclpy = Python client library\\nAdditionally, other client libraries have been developed by the ROS community.\\nSee the\\nROS 2 Client Libraries\\narticle for more details.\\nDiscovery\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDiscovery of nodes happens automatically through the underlying middleware of ROS 2.\\nIt can be summarized as follows:\\nWhen a node is started, it advertises its presence to other nodes on the network with the same ROS domain (set with the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable).\\nNodes respond to this advertisement with information about themselves so that the appropriate connections can be made and the nodes can communicate.\\nNodes periodically advertise their presence so that connections can be made with new-found entities, even after the initial discovery period.\\nNodes advertise to other nodes when they go offline.\\nNodes will only establish connections with other nodes if they have compatible\\nQuality of Service\\nsettings.\\nTake the\\ntalker-listener demo\\nfor example.\\nRunning the C++ talker node in one terminal will publish messages on a topic,\\nand the Python listener node running in another terminal  will subscribe to messages on the same topic.\\nYou should see that these nodes discover each other automatically, and begin to exchange messages.\\nRelated Content\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSee the ROS 2 citations\\nfor more explanation of concepts and citable resources.\\nFor a brief video introduction to ROS 2, see this community contributed

       "  'content': \"Warning\\nYou're reading the documentation for a version of ROS 2 that has reached its EOL (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported.\\n        If you want up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nThe ROS_DOMAIN_ID\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOverview\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAs explained elsewhere, the default middleware that ROS 2 uses for communication is DDS.\\nIn DDS, the primary mechanism for having different logical networks share a physical network is known as the Domain ID.\\nROS 2 nodes on the same domain can freely discover and send messages to each other, while ROS 2 nodes on different domains cannot.\\nAll ROS 2 nodes use domain ID 0 by default.\\nTo avoid interference between different groups of computers running ROS 2 on the same network, a different domain ID should be set for each group.\\nChoosing a domain ID (short version)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe text below explains the derivation of the range of domain IDs that should be used in ROS 2.\\nTo skip that background and just choose a safe number, simply choose a domain ID between 0 and 101, inclusive.\\nChoosing a domain ID (long version)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe domain ID is used by DDS to compute the UDP ports that will be used for discovery and communication.\\nSee\\nthis article\\nfor details on how the ports are computed.\\nRemembering our basic networking, the UDP port is an\\nunsigned 16-bit integer\\n.\\nThus, the highest port number that can be allocated is 65535.\\nDoing some math with the formula in the article above, this means that the highest domain ID that can possibly be assigned is 232, while the lowest that can be assigned is 0.\\nPlatform-specific constraints\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor maximum compatibility, some additional platform-specific constraints should be followed when choosing a domain ID.\\nIn particular, it is best to avoid allocating domain IDs in the operating systemâ\\x80\\x99s\\nephemeral port range\\n.\\nThis avoids possible conflicts between the ports used by the ROS 2 nodes and other networking services on the computers.\\nHere are some platform-specific notes about ephemeral ports.\\nLinux\\nmacOS\\nWindows\\nBy default, the Linux kernel uses ports 32768-60999 for ephemeral ports.\\nThis means that domain IDs 0-101 and 215-232 can be safely used without colliding with ephemeral ports.\\nThe ephemeral port range is configurable in Linux by setting custom values in\\n/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range\\n.\\nIf a custom ephemeral port range is used, the above numbers may have to be adjusted accordingly.\\nBy default, the ephemeral port range on macOS is 49152-65535.\\nThis means that domain IDs 0-166 can be safely used without colliding with ephemeral ports.\\nThe ephemeral port range is configurable in macOS by setting custom sysctl values for\\nnet.inet.ip.portrange.first\\nand\\nnet.inet.ip.portrange.last\\n.\\nIf a custom ephemeral port range is used, the above numbers may have to be adjusted accordingly.\\nBy default, the ephemeral port range on Windows is 49152-65535.\\nThis means that domain IDs 0-166 can be safely used without colliding with ephemeral ports.\\nThe ephemeral port range is configurable in Windows by\\nusing netsh\\n.\\nIf a custom ephemeral port range is used, the above numbers may have to be adjusted accordingly.\\nParticipant constraints\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor each ROS 2 process running on a computer, one DDS â\\x80\\x9cparticipantâ\\x80\\x9d is created.\\nSince each DDS participant takes up two ports on the computer, running more than 120 ROS 2 processes on one computer may spill over into other domain IDs or the ephemeral ports.\\nTo see why, consider the domain IDs 1 and 2.\\nDomain ID 1 uses port 7650 and 7651 for multicast.\\nDomain ID 2 uses port 7900 and 7901 for multicast.\\nWhen creating the 1st process (zeroth participant) in domain ID 1, the ports 7660 and 7661 are used for unicast.\\nWhen creating the 120th process (119th participant) in domain ID 1, the ports 7898 and 7899 are used for unicast.\\nWhen creating the 121st process (120th participant) in domain ID 1, the ports 7900 and 7901 are used for unicast and overlap with domain ID 2.\\nIf it is known that the computer will only ever be on a single domain ID at a time, and the domain ID is low enough, it is safe to create more ROS 2 processes than this.\\nWhen choosing a domain ID that is near the top of the range of platform-specific domain IDs, one additional constraint should be considered.\\nFor instance, assume a Linux computer with a domain ID of 101:\\nThe zeroâ\\x80\\x99th ROS 2 process on the computer will connect to ports 32650, 32651, 32660, and 32661.\\nThe first ROS 2 process on the computer will connect to ports 32650, 32651, 32662, and 32663.\\nThe 53rd ROS 2 process on the computer will connect to ports 32650, 32651, 32766, and 32767.\\nThe 54th ROS 2 process on the computer will connect to ports 32650, 32651, 32768, and 32769, running into the ephemeral port range.\\nThus the maximum number of processes that should be created when using domain ID 101 on Linux is

information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nAbout Quality of Service settings\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOverview\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 offers a rich variety of Quality of Service (QoS) policies that allow you to tune communication between nodes.\\nWith the right set of Quality of Service policies, ROS 2 can be as reliable as TCP or as best-effort as UDP, with many, many possible states in between.\\nUnlike ROS 1, which primarily only supported TCP, ROS 2 benefits from the flexibility of the underlying DDS transport in environments with lossy wireless networks where a â\\x80\\x9cbest effortâ\\x80\\x9d policy would be more suitable, or in real-time computing systems where the right Quality of Service profile is needed to meet deadlines.\\nA set of QoS â\\x80\\x9cpoliciesâ\\x80\\x9d combine to form a QoS â\\x80\\x9cprofileâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nGiven the complexity of choosing the correct QoS policies for a given scenario, ROS 2 provides a set of predefined QoS profiles for common use cases (e.g. sensor data).\\nAt the same time, developers are given the flexibility to control specific policies of the QoS profiles.\\nQoS profiles can be specified for publishers, subscriptions, service servers and clients.\\nA QoS profile can be applied independently to each instance of the aforementioned entities, but if different profiles are used, it is possible that they will be incompatible, preventing the delivery of messages.\\nQoS policies\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe base QoS profile currently includes settings for the following policies:\\nHistory\\nKeep last\\n: only store up to N samples, configurable via the queue depth option.\\nKeep all\\n: store all samples, subject to the configured resource limits of the underlying middleware.\\nDepth\\nQueue size\\n: only honored if the â\\x80\\x9chistoryâ\\x80\\x9d policy was set to â\\x80\\x9ckeep lastâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nReliability\\nBest effort\\n: attempt to deliver samples, but may lose them if the network is not robust.\\nReliable\\n: guarantee that samples are delivered, may retry multiple times.\\nDurability\\nTransient local\\n: the publisher becomes responsible for persisting samples for â\\x80\\x9clate-joiningâ\\x80\\x9d subscriptions.\\nVolatile\\n: no attempt is made to persist samples.\\nDeadline\\nDuration\\n: the expected maximum amount of time between subsequent messages being published to a topic\\nLifespan\\nDuration\\n: the maximum amount of time between the publishing and the reception of a message without the message being considered stale or expired (expired messages are silently dropped and are effectively never received).\\nLiveliness\\nAutomatic\\n: the system will consider all of the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s publishers to be alive for another â\\x80\\x9clease durationâ\\x80\\x9d when any one of its publishers has published a message.\\nManual by topic\\n: the system will consider the publisher to be alive for another â\\x80\\x9clease durationâ\\x80\\x9d if it manually asserts that it is still alive (via a call to the publisher API).\\nLease Duration\\nDuration\\n: the maximum period of time a publisher has to indicate that it is alive before the system considers it to have lost liveliness (losing liveliness could be an indication of a failure).\\nFor each of the policies that is not a duration, there is also the option of â\\x80\\x9csystem defaultâ\\x80\\x9d, which uses the default of the underlying middleware.\\nFor each of the policies that is a duration, there also exists a â\\x80\\x9cdefaultâ\\x80\\x9d option that means the duration is unspecified, which the underlying middleware will usually interpret as an infinitely long duration.\\nComparison to ROS 1\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe â\\x80\\x9chistoryâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdepthâ\\x80\\x9d policies in ROS 2 combine to provide functionality akin to the queue size in ROS 1.\\nThe â\\x80\\x9creliabilityâ\\x80\\x9d policy in ROS 2 is akin to the use of either UDPROS (only in\\nroscpp\\n) for â\\x80\\x9cbest effortâ\\x80\\x9d, or TCPROS (ROS 1 default) for â\\x80\\x9creliableâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nNote however that even the reliable policy in ROS 2 is implemented using UDP, which allows for multicasting if appropriate.\\nThe â\\x80\\x9cdurabilityâ\\x80\\x9d policy â\\x80\\x9ctransient localâ\\x80\\x9d, combined with any depth, provides functionality similar to that of â\\x80\\x9clatchingâ\\x80\\x9d publishers.\\nThe remaining policies in ROS 2 are not akin to anything that is available in ROS 1, meaning that ROS 2 is more featureful than ROS 1 in this respect.\\nIt is possible that in the future, even more QoS policies will be available in ROS 2.\\nQoS profiles\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nProfiles allow developers to focus on their applications without worrying about every QoS setting possible.\\nA QoS profile defines a set of policies that are expected to go well together for a particular use case.\\nThe currently defined QoS profiles are:\\nDefault QoS settings for publishers and subscriptions\\nIn order to make the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2 easier, exercising a similar network behavior is desirable.\\nBy default, publishers and subscriptions in ROS 2 have â\\x80\\x9ckeep lastâ\\x80\\x9d for history with a queue size of 10, â\\x80\\x9creliableâ\\x80\\x9d for reliability, â\\x80\\x9cvolatileâ\\x80\\x9d for durability, and â\\x80\\x9csystem defaultâ\\x80\\x9d for liveliness.\\nDeadline, lifespan, and lease durations are also all set to â\\x80\\x9cdefaultâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nServices\\nIn the same vein as publishers and subscriptions, services are reliable.\\nIt is especially important for services to use volatile durability, as otherwise service servers that re-start may receive outdated requests.\\nWhile the client is protected from receiving multiple responses, the server is not protected from side-effects of receiving the outdated requests.\\nSensor data\\nFor sensor data, in most cases itâ\\x80\\x99s more important to receive readings in a timely fashion, rather than ensuring that all of them arrive.\\nThat is, developers want the latest samples as soon as they are captured, at the expense of maybe losing some.\\nFor that reason the sensor data profile uses best effort reliability and a smaller queue size.\\nParameters\\nParameters in ROS 2 are based on services, and as such have a similar profile.\\nThe difference is that parameters use a much larger queue depth so that requests do not get lost when, for example, the parameter client is unable to reach the parameter service server.\\nSystem default\\nThis uses the RMW implementationâ\\x80\\x99s default values for all of the policies.\\nDifferent RMW implementations may have different defaults.\\nClick here\\nfor the specific policies in use for the above profiles.\\nThe settings in these profiles are subject to further tweaks, based on the feedback from the community.\\nQoS compatibilities\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNote:\\nThis section refers to publishers and subscriptions but the content applies to service servers and clients in the same manner.\\nQoS profiles may be configured for publishers and subscriptions independently.\\nA connection between a publisher and a subscription is only made if the pair has compatible QoS profiles.\\nQoS profile compatibility is determined based on a â\\x80\\x9cRequest vs Offeredâ\\x80\\x9d model.\\nSubscriptions\\nrequest\\na QoS profile that is the â\\x80\\x9cminimum qualityâ\\x80\\x9d that it is willing to accept, and publishers\\noffer\\na QoS profile that is the â\\x80\\x9cmaximum qualityâ\\x80\\x9d that it is able to provide.\\nConnections are only made if every policy of the requested QoS profile is not more stringent than that of the offered QoS profile.\\nMultiple subscriptions can be connected to a single publisher simultaneously even if their requested QoS profiles are different.\\nThe compatibility between a publisher and a subscription is unaffected by the presence of other publishers and subscriptions.\\nThe following tables show the compatibility of the different policy settings and the result:\\nCompatibility of reliability QoS policies:\\nPublisher\\nSubscription\\nCompatible\\nBest effort\\nBest effort\\nYes\\nBest effort\\nReliable\\nNo\\nReliable\\nBest effort\\nYes\\nReliable\\nReliable\\nYes\\nCompatibility of durability QoS policies:\\nPublisher\\nSubscription\\nCompatible\\nVolatile\\nVolatile\\nYes\\nVolatile\\nTransient local\\nNo\\nTransient

order for a connection to be made, all of the policies that affect compatibility must be compatible.\\nFor example, even if a requested and offered QoS profile pair has compatible reliability QoS policies, but they have incompatible durability QoS policies, a connection will still not be made.\\nWhen connections are not made, no messages will be passed between the publisher and subscription.\\nThere are mechanisms to detect this situation, which will be covered in a later section.\\nComparison to ROS 1\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nHistorically in ROS 1, any publisher and subscriber with the same message type on the same topic would be connected.\\nThe possibility of incompatible requested and offered QoS profiles is something new to be aware of when using ROS 2.\\nQoS events\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSome QoS policies have possible events related to them.\\nDevelopers may provide each publisher and subscription with callback functions that are triggered by these QoS events

deadline missed\\nThe publisher has not published a message within the expected duration that was set out by the deadline QoS policy.\\nLiveliness lost\\nThe publisher has failed to indicate its liveliness within the lease duration.\\nOffered incompatible QoS\\nThe publisher has encountered a subscription on the same topic that is requesting a QoS profile that the offered QoS profile cannot satisfy, resulting in no connection between the publisher and that subscription.\\nDevelopers may subscribe to the following QoS events that are associated with a subscription:\\nRequested deadline

Background\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS applications typically communicate through interfaces of one of three types: messages, services and actions.\\nROS 2 uses a simplified description language, the interface definition language (IDL), to describe these interfaces.\\nThis description makes it easy for ROS tools to automatically generate source code for the interface type in several target languages.\\nIn this document we will describe the supported types.\\nmsg:\\n.msg\\nfiles are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages.\\nsrv:\\n.srv\\nfiles describe a service. They are composed of two parts: a request and a response. The request and response are message declarations.\\naction:\\n.action\\nfiles describe actions. They are composed of three parts: a goal, a result, and feedback.\\nEach part is a message declaration itself.\\n2.

New features in ROS 2 interfaces\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS 2 IDL is closely related to the\\nROS 1 IDL\\n.\\nMost existing ROS 1\\n.msg\\nand\\n.srv\\nfiles should be usable as-is with ROS 2.\\nAtop ROS 1â\\x80\\x99s existing feature set, the ROS 2 IDL introduces some new features, namely:\\nbounded arrays\\n: Whereas the ROS 1 IDL allows unbounded arrays (e.g.,\\nint32[]\\nfoo\\n) and fixed-size arrays (e.g.,\\nint32[5]\\nbar\\n), the ROS 2 IDL further allows bounded arrays (e.g.,\\nint32[<=5]\\nbat\\n).\\nThere are use cases in which itâ\\x80\\x99s important to be able to place an upper bound on the size of an array without committing to always using that much space (e.g., in a real-time system in which you need to preallocate all memory that will be used during execution).\\nbounded strings\\n: Whereas the ROS 1 IDL allows unbounded strings (e.g.,\\nstring\\nfoo\\n), the ROS 2 IDL further allows bounded strings (e.g.,\\nstring<=5\\nbar\\n).\\ndefault values\\n: Whereas the ROS 1 IDL allows constant fields (e.g.,\\nint32\\nX=123\\n), the ROS 2 IDL further allows default values to be specified (e.g.,\\nint32\\nX\\n123\\n).\\nThe default value is used when constructing a message/service object and can be subsequently overridden by assigning to the field.\\nYou can also specify default values for action parts.'},\n",

callbacks\\nInteracting with parameters\\nSetting initial parameter values when running a node\\nSetting initial parameter values when launching nodes\\nManipulating parameter values at runtime\\nMigrating from ROS 1\\nOverview\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nParameters in ROS are associated with individual nodes.\\nParameters are used to configure nodes at startup (and during runtime), without changing the code.\\nThe lifetime of a parameter is tied to the lifetime of the node (though the node could implement some sort of persistence to reload values after restart).\\nParameters are addressed by node name, node namespace, parameter name, and parameter namespace.\\nProviding a parameter namespace is optional.\\nEach parameter consists of a key, a value, and a descriptor.\\nThe key is a string and the value is one of the following types: bool, int64, float64, string, byte[], bool[], int64[], float64[] or string[].\\nBy default all descriptors are empty, but can contain parameter descriptions, value ranges, type information, and additional constraints.\\nFor an hands-on tutorial with ROS parameters see\\nUnderstanding parameters\\n.\\nParameters background\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDeclaring parameters\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBy default, a node needs to\\ndeclare\\nall of the parameters that it will accept during its lifetime.\\nThis is so that the type and the name of the parameter are well-defined at node startup time, which reduces the chances of misconfiguration later on.\\nSee\\nUsing parameters in a class (C++)\\nor\\nUsing parameters in a class (Python)\\nfor tutorials on declaring and using parameters from a node.\\nFor some types of nodes, not all of the parameters will be known ahead of time.\\nIn these cases, the node can be instantiated with\\nallow_undeclared_parameters\\nset to\\ntrue\\n, which will allow parameters to be get and set on the node even if they havenâ\\x80\\x99t been declared.\\nParameter types\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEach parameter on a ROS 2 node has one of the pre-defined parameter types as mentioned in the Overview.\\nBy default, attempts to change the type of a declared parameter at runtime will fail.\\nThis prevents common mistakes, such as putting a boolean value into an integer parameter.\\nIf a parameter needs to be multiple different types, and the code using the parameter can handle it, this default behavior can be changed.\\nWhen the parameter is declared, it should be declared using a\\nParameterDescriptor\\nwith the\\ndynamic_typing\\nmember variable set to\\ntrue\\n.\\nParameter callbacks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA ROS 2 node can register two different types of callbacks to be informed when changes are happening to parameters.\\nThe reason that there are two types of callbacks is to have a chance to intervene before the parameter change happens, and to have a chance to react after the parameter change happens.\\nA node can register for both, either, or none of the callback types.\\nBoth types are described below.\\nThe first type is known as a â\\x80\\x9cset parameterâ\\x80\\x9d callback, and can be installed by calling\\nadd_on_set_parameters_callback\\n.\\nThe callback should accept a list of\\nParameter\\nobjects, and return an\\nrcl_interfaces/msg/SetParametersResult\\n.\\nThis callback will be called before a parameter is declared or changed on a node.\\nThe main purpose of this callback is to give the user the ability to inspect the upcoming change to the parameter and explicitly reject the change.\\nNote\\nIt is important that â\\x80\\x9cset parameterâ\\x80\\x9d callbacks have no side-effects.\\nSince multiple â\\x80\\x9cset parameterâ\\x80\\x9d callbacks can be chained, there is no way for an individual callback to know if a later callback will reject the update.\\nIf the individual callback were to make changes to the class it is in, for instance, it may get out-of-sync with the actual parameter.\\nTo get a callback\\nafter\\na parameter has been successfully changed, see the next type of callback below.\\nThe second type of callback is known as an â\\x80\\x9con parameter eventâ\\x80\\x9d callback, and can be installed by calling\\non_parameter_event\\n.\\nThe callback should accept an\\nrcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent\\nobject, and return nothing.\\nThis callback will be called after all parameters have been declared, changed, or deleted.\\nThe main purpose of this callback is to give the user the ability to react to changes from parameters that have successfully been accepted.\\nInteracting with parameters\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 nodes can perform parameter operations through node APIs as described in\\nUsing parameters in a class (C++)\\nor\\nUsing parameters in a class (Python)\\n.\\nExternal processes can perform parameter operations via parameter services that are created by default when a node is instantiated.\\nThe services that are created by default are:\\n/node_name/describe_parameters: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters\\n.\\nGiven a list of parameter names, returns a list of descriptors associated with the parameters.\\n/node_name/get_parameter_types: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes\\n.\\nGiven a list of parameter names, returns a list of parameter types associated with the parameters.\\n/node_name/get_parameters: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters\\n.\\nGiven a list of parameter names, returns a list of parameter values associated with the parameters.\\n/node_name/list_parameters: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters\\n.\\nGiven an optional list of parameter prefixes, returns a list of the available parameters with that prefix.  If the prefixes are empty, returns all parameters.\\n/node_name/set_parameters: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters\\n.\\nGiven a list of parameter names and values, attempts to set the parameters on the node.  Returns a list of results from trying to set each parameter; some of them may have succeeded and some may have failed.\\n/node_name/set_parameters_atomically: Uses a service type of\\nrcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically\\n.\\nGiven a list of parameter names and values, attempts to set the parameters on the node.  Returns a single result from trying to set all parameters, so if one failed, all of them failed.\\nSetting initial parameter values when running a node\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInitial parameter values can be set when running the node either through individual command-line arguments, or through YAML files.\\nSee\\nSetting parameters directly from the command line\\nfor examples on how to set initial parameter values.\\nSetting initial parameter values when launching nodes\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInitial parameter values can also be set when running the node through the ROS 2 launch facility.\\nSee\\nthis document\\nfor information on how to specify parameters via launch.\\nManipulating parameter values at runtime\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nros2\\nparam\\ncommand is the general way to interact with parameters for nodes that are already running.\\nros2\\nparam\\nuses the parameter service API as described above to perform the various operations.\\nSee\\nthe how-to guide\\nfor details on how to use\\nros2\\nparam\\n.\\nMigrating from ROS 1\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nLaunch file migration guide\\nexplains how to migrate\\nparam\\nand\\nrosparam\\nlaunch tags from ROS 1 to ROS 2.\\nThe\\nYAML parameter file migration guide\\nexplains how to migrate parameter files from ROS 1 to ROS 2.\\nIn ROS 1, the\\nroscore\\nacted like a global parameter blackboard where all nodes could get and set parameters.\\nSince there is no central\\nroscore\\nin ROS 2, that functionality no longer exists.\\nThe recommended approach in ROS 2 is to use per-node parameters that are closely tied to the nodes that use them.\\nIf a global blackboard is still needed, it is possible to create a dedicated node for this purpose.\\nROS 2 ships with one in in the\\nros-galactic-demo-nodes-cpp\\npackage called\\nparameter_blackboard\\n; it can be run with:\\nros2 run demo_nodes_cpp parameter_blackboard\\nThe code for the\\nparameter_blackboard\\nis\\nhere\\n.\"},\n",

for example by the subscription options:\\nC++\\nPython\\nmy_callback_group\\n=\\ncreate_callback_group\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nCallbackGroupType\\n::\\nMutuallyExclusive\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSubscriptionOptions\\noptions\\n;\\noptions\\n.\\ncallback_group\\n=\\nmy_callback_group\\n;\\nmy_subscription\\n=\\ncreate_subscription\\n<\\nInt32\\n>\\n(\\n\"/topic\"\\n,\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nSensorDataQoS\\n(),\\ncallback\\n,\\noptions\\n);\\nmy_callback_group\\n=\\nMutuallyExclusiveCallbackGroup\\n()\\nmy_subscription\\n=\\nself\\n.\\ncreate_subscription\\n(\\nInt32\\n,\\n\"/topic\"\\n,\\nself\\n.\\ncallback\\n,\\nqos_profile\\n=\\n1\\n,\\ncallback_group\\n=\\nmy_callback_group\\n)\\nAll subscriptions, timers, etc. that are created without the indication of a callback group are assigned to the\\ndefault callback group\\n.\\nThe default callback group can be queried via\\nNodeBaseInterface::get_default_callback_group()\\nin rclcpp\\nand by\\nNode.default_callback_group\\nin rclpy.\\nThere are two types of callback groups, where the type has to be specified at instantiation time:\\nMutually exclusive:\\nCallbacks of this group must not be executed in parallel.\\nReentrant:\\nCallbacks of this group may be executed in parallel.\\nCallbacks of different callback groups may always be executed in parallel.\\nThe Multi-Threaded Executor uses its threads as a pool to process a many callbacks as possible in parallel according to these conditions.\\nFor tips on how to use callback groups efficiently, see\\nUsing Callback Groups\\n.\\nThe Executor base class in rclcpp also has the function\\nadd_callback_group(..)\\n, which allows distributing callback groups to different Executors.\\nBy configuring the underlying threads using the operating system scheduler, specific callbacks can be prioritized over other callbacks.\\nFor example, the subscriptions and timers of a control loop can be prioritized over all other subscriptions and standard services of a node.\\nThe\\nexamples_rclcpp_cbg_executor package\\nprovides a demo of this mechanism.\\nScheduling semantics\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIf the processing time of the callbacks is shorter than the period with which messages and events occur, the Executor basically processes them in FIFO order.\\nHowever, if the processing time of some callbacks is longer, messages and events will be queued on the lower layers of the stack.\\nThe wait set mechanism reports only very little information about these queues to the Executor.\\nIn detail, it only reports whether there are any messages for a certain topic or not.\\nThe Executor uses this information to process the messages (including services and actions) in a round-robin fashion - but not in FIFO order.\\nThe following flow diagram visualizes this scheduling semantics.\\nThis semantics was first described in a\\npaper by Casini et al. at ECRTS 2019\\n.\\n(Note: The paper also explains that timer events are prioritized over all other messages.\\nThis prioritization was removed in Eloquent.\\n)\\nOutlook\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhile the three Executors of rclcpp work well for most applications there are some issues that make them not suitable for real-time applications, which require well-defined execution times, determinism, and custom control over the execution order.\\nHere is a summary of some of these issues:\\nComplex and mixed scheduling semantics.\\nIdeally you want well defined scheduling semantics to perform a formal timing analysis.\\nCallbacks may suffer from priority inversion.\\nHigher priority callbacks may be blocked by lower priority callbacks.\\nNo explicit control over the callbacks execution order.\\nNo built-in control over triggering for specific topics.\\nAdditionally, the executor overhead in terms of CPU and memory usage is considerable.\\nThe Static Single-Threaded Executor reduces this overhead greatly but it might be not enough for some applications.\\nThese issues have been partially addressed by the following developments:\\nrclcpp WaitSet\\n: The\\nWaitSet\\nclass of rclcpp allows waiting directly on subscriptions, timers, service servers, action servers, etc. instead of using an Executor.\\nIt can be used to implement deterministic, user-defined processing sequences, possibly processing multiple messages from different subscriptions together.\\nThe\\nexamples_rclcpp_wait_set package\\nprovides several examples for the use of this user-level wait set mechanism.\\nrclc Executor\\n: This Executor from the C Client Library\\nrclc\\ndeveloped for micro-ROS gives the user fine-grained control over the execution order of callbacks and allows for custom trigger conditions to activate callbacks.\\nFurthermore, it implements ideas of the Logical Execution Time (LET) semantics.\\nFurther information\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nMichael PÃ¶hnl et al.:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cROS 2 Executor: How to make it efficient, real-time and deterministic?â\\x80\\x9d\\n.

to\\ncatkin\\nvs.\\nament\\n, because format 2 has been around for a while and\\ncatkin\\nsupports it, so developers could already update their manifests to format 2.\\nBut thereâ\\x80\\x99s a ton of ROS code out there that uses format 1, so we should support it.\\nThis implementation could be improved, e.g., by reasoning over the various flavors of depend tags and how they differ between formats 1 and 2.\\nament_tools\\n:\\nAdd a new\\ncatkin\\nbuild type to\\nament\\n.\\nThis implementation just treats\\ncatkin\\npackages the same as plain\\ncmake\\npackages, which seems to work fine.\\nIt could be made more sophisticated.\\nExample usage:\\nGet the ROS 2 code as usual, using the branches mentioned above.\\nAdd to your workspace some\\ncatkin\\nROS packages, ensuring that all of their dependencies are satisfied (either also present in the workspace or installed elsewhere with appropriate setup shell files sourced).\\nBuild as usual (e.g.,\\n./src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.by\\nbuild\\n).\\nVoila: your existing code isnâ\\x80\\x99t suddenly broken just because thereâ\\x80\\x99s a new builder tool in use.\\nVariation: Building ROS packages with\\nament\\nbuild\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s say that you love the new\\nament\\ntool and want to use it to build your existing ROS packages that use\\ncatkin\\ninternally.\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s an example of how to do that, by doing a minimal installation of\\nament\\nand then using it to build a workspace full of ROS\\ncatkin\\npackages:\\nmkdir\\n-p\\n~/ament_ws/src\\ncd\\n~/ament_ws/src\\ngit\\nclone\\nhttps://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon.git\\ngit\\nclone\\nhttps://github.com/ament/ament_package.git\\ncd\\nament_package\\ngit\\ncheckout\\ncatkin\\ncd\\n..\\ngit\\nclone\\nhttps://github.com/ament/ament_tools.git\\ncd\\nament_tools\\ngit\\ncheckout\\ncatkin\\ncd\\n../..\\n./src/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py\\nbuild\\nNow

and you want to add a new package using the\\ncatkin\\nAPI.\\nTo make this work, we need a Python3 installation of\\ncatkin\\n(the binary debians use Python2.7).\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s an example of doing that, installing to\\n$HOME/catkin\\n:\\n# install

on the\\ncatkin\\nbranches in\\nament_package\\nand\\nament_tools\\n.\\nAdd to that workspace the\\nimage_tools_catkin\\npackage from\\nhttps://github.com/gerkey/catment\\n.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a simple port of the ROS 2\\nimage_tools\\npackage, taking it from the\\nament\\nAPI to the\\ncatkin\\nAPI.\\nTo build it:\\ncd\\n~/ros2_ws\\n.\\n$HOME\\n/catkin/setup.bash\\n./src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py\\nbuild\\nVoila: when adding new packages atop ROS 2, youâ\\x80\\x99re free to choose which CMake API

like\\nrclcpp\\narenâ\\x80\\x99t\\ncatkin\\npackages.\\nThat constraint needs to be relaxed somehow.\\nTODO\\n: The same demo but with a\\nament\\npackage that depends on a\\ncatkin\\npackage (this is easy).\\nTODO\\n: The same demo but with a package that has a vanilla\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nthat uses neither\\nament\\nnor\\ncatkin\\n, and provides a manually generated\\nfooConfig.cmake\\nfile that

using\\ncatkin_make_isolated\\nto build everything.\\nHere is a patch that allows you to do that:\\ncatkin\\n:\\nAdd support for packages that declare themselves to have a build type of\\nament_*\\n.\\nThis implementation calls out to\\nament\\nto build each such package.\\nWhile\\nament_cmake\\npackages can be treated as plain\\ncmake\\npackages (as we did when

let\\nament\\nhandle it.\\nAlso in this patch, we add the\\nbuildtool_export_depend\\npackages to the set that are considered when building.\\ncatkin_pkg\\n:\\nAlso in this patch, we add the\\nbuildtool_export_depend\\npackages to the set that are considered when computing the topological order.\\nBecause weâ\\x80\\x99re going to call out to\\nament\\nbuild\\n, we will also need a

in the\\nament\\nGitHub\\norganization:\\nThe\\nament_package\\nPackage\\nThe\\nament_cmake\\nRepository\\nThe\\nament_lint\\nRepository\\nBuild tools\\nThe\\nament_package\\nPackage\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLocated on\\nGitHub\\nat\\nament/ament_package\\n, this repository contains a single\\nament Python package\\nthat provides various utilities for\\nament packages\\n, e.g. templates for environment hooks.\\nAll\\nament packages\\nmust contain a single\\npackage.xml\\nfile at the root of the package regardless of their underlying build

package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAny\\npackage\\nwhich contains a\\npackage.xml\\nand follows the packaging guidelines of\\nament\\n, regardless of the underlying build system.\\nSince the term\\nament package\\nis build system agnostic, there can be different kinds of\\nament packages\\n, e.g.\\nament CMake package\\n,\\nament Python package\\n, etc.\\nHere is a list of common package types that you might run into in this software stack:\\nCMake package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAny\\npackage\\ncontaining a plain CMake project and a\\npackage.xml\\nmanifest file.\\nament CMake package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA\\nCMake package\\nthat also follows the\\nament\\npackaging guidelines.\\nPython package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAny\\npackage\\ncontaining a\\nsetuptools\\nbased Python project and a\\npackage.xml\\nmanifest file.\\nament Python package\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA\\nPython package\\nthat also follows the\\nament\\npackaging guidelines.\\nThe\\nament_cmake\\nRepository\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLocated on\\nGitHub\\nat\\nament/ament_cmake\\n, this repository contains many â\\x80\\x9cament CMakeâ\\x80\\x9d and pure CMake packages which provide the infrastructure in CMake that is required to create â\\x80\\x9cament CMakeâ\\x80\\x9d packages.\\nIn this context â\\x80\\x9cament CMakeâ\\x80\\x9d packages means:\\nament\\npackages that are built using CMake.\\nSo the\\npackages\\nin this repository provide the necessary CMake functions/macros and CMake Modules to facilitate creating more â\\x80\\x9cament CMakeâ\\x80\\x9d (or\\nament_cmake\\n) packages.\\nPackages of this type are identified with the\\n<build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>\\ntag in the\\n<export>\\ntag of the\\npackage.xml\\nfile.\\nThe\\npackages\\nin this repository are extremely modular, but there is a single â\\x80\\x9cbottleneckâ\\x80\\x9d\\npackage\\ncalled\\nament_cmake\\n.\\nAnyone can depend on the\\nament_cmake\\npackage\\nto get all of the aggregate functionality of the\\npackages\\nin this repository.\\nHere a list of the\\npackages\\nin the repository along with a short description:\\nament_cmake\\naggregates all other\\npackages\\nin this repository, users need only to depend on this\\nament_cmake_auto\\nprovides convenience CMake functions which automatically handle a lot of the tedious parts of writing a\\npackage\\nâ\\x80\\x99s\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nfile\\nament_cmake_core\\nprovides all built-in core concepts for\\nament\\n, e.g. environment hooks, resource indexing, symbolic linking install and others\\nament_cmake_gmock\\nadds convenience functions for making gmock based unit tests\\nament_cmake_gtest\\nadds convenience functions for making gtest based automated tests\\nament_cmake_nose\\nadds convenience functions for making nosetests based python automated tests\\nament_cmake_python\\nprovides CMake functions for\\npackages\\nthat contain Python code\\nsee the\\nament_cmake_python user documentation\\nament_cmake_test\\naggregates different kinds of tests, e.g. gtest and nosetests, under a single target using\\nCTest\\nThe\\nament_cmake_core\\npackage\\ncontains a lot of the CMake infrastructure that makes it possible to cleanly pass information between\\npackages\\nusing conventional interfaces.\\nThis makes the\\npackages\\nhave more decoupled build interfaces with other\\npackages\\n, promoting their reuse and encouraging conventions in the build systems of different\\npackages\\n.\\nFor instance it provides a standard way to pass include directories, libraries, definitions, and dependencies between\\npackages\\nso that consumers of this information can access this information in a conventional way.\\nThe\\nament_cmake_core\\npackage\\nalso provides features of the\\nament\\nbuild system like symbolic link installation, which allows you to symbolically link files from either the source space or the build space into the install space rather than copying them.\\nThis allows you to install once and then edit non-generated resources like Python code and configuration files without having to rerun the install step for them to take effect.\\nThis feature essentially replaces the â\\x80\\x9cdevel spaceâ\\x80\\x9d from\\ncatkin\\nbecause it has most of the advantages with few of the complications or drawbacks.\\nAnother feature provided by\\nament_cmake_core\\nis the\\npackage\\nresource indexing which is a way for\\npackages\\nto indicate that they contain a resource of some type.\\nThe design of this feature makes it much more efficient to answer simple questions like what\\npackages\\nare in this prefix (e.g.\\n/usr/local\\n) because it only requires that you list the files in a single possible location under that prefix.\\nYou can read more about this feature in the\\ndesign docs\\nfor the resource index.\\nLike\\ncatkin\\n,\\nament_cmake_core\\nalso provides environment setup files and\\npackage\\nspecific environment hooks.\\nThe environment setup files, often named something like\\nsetup.bash\\n, are a place for\\npackage\\ndevelopers to define changes to the environment that are needed to utilize their\\npackage\\n.\\nThe developers are able to do this using an

       "  'content': \"Warning\\nYou're reading the documentation for a version of ROS 2 that has reached its EOL (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported.\\n        If you want up-to-date information, please have a look at\\nJazzy\\n.\\nAbout internal ROS 2 interfaces\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe internal ROS interfaces are public C\\nAPIs\\nthat are intended for use by developers who are creating\\nclient libraries\\nor adding a new underlying middleware, but are not intended for use by typical ROS users.\\nThe ROS\\nclient libraries\\nprovide the user facing\\nAPIs\\nthat most ROS users are familiar with, and may come in a variety of programming languages.\\nInternal API Architecture Overview\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are two main internal interfaces:\\nthe ROS middleware interface (\\nrmw\\nAPI\\n)\\nthe ROS client library interface (\\nrcl\\nAPI\\n)\\nThe\\nrmw\\nAPI\\nis the interface between the ROS 2 software stack and the underlying middleware implementation.\\nThe underlying middleware used for ROS 2 is either a DDS or RTPS implementation, and is responsible for discovery, publish and subscribe mechanics, request-reply mechanics for services, and serialization of message types.\\nThe\\nrcl\\nAPI\\nis a slightly higher level\\nAPI\\nwhich is used to implement the\\nclient libraries\\nand does not touch the middleware implementation directly, but rather does so through the ROS middleware interface (\\nrmw\\nAPI\\n) abstraction.\\nAs the diagram shows, these\\nAPIs\\nare stacked such that the typical ROS user will use the\\nclient library\\nAPI\\n, e.g.\\nrclcpp\\n, to implement their code (executable or library).\\nThe implementation of the\\nclient libraries\\n, e.g.\\nrclcpp\\n, use the\\nrcl\\ninterface which provides access to the ROS graph and graph events.\\nThe\\nrcl\\nimplementation in turn uses the\\nrmw\\nAPI\\nto access the ROS graph.\\nThe purpose of the\\nrcl\\nimplementation is to provide a common implementation for more complex ROS concepts and utilities that may be used by various\\nclient libraries\\n, while remaining agnostic to the underlying middleware being used.\\nThe purpose of the\\nrmw\\ninterface is to capture the absolute minimum middleware functionality needed to support ROSâ\\x80\\x99s client libraries.\\nFinally, the implementation of the\\nrmw\\nAPI\\nis provided by a middleware implementation specific\\npackage\\n, e.g.\\nrmw_fastrtps_cpp\\n, the library of which is compiled against vendor specific DDS interfaces and types.\\nIn the diagram above there is also a box labeled\\nros_to_dds\\n, and the purpose of this box is to represent a category of possible packages which allow the user to access DDS vendor specific objects and settings using the ROS equivalents.\\nOne of the goals of this abstraction interface is to completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a minimal impact on the users code.\\nHowever, we recognize that on occasion it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust settings despite the consequences that might have.\\nBy requiring the use of one of these packages in order to access the underlying DDS vendorâ\\x80\\x99s objects, we can avoid exposing vendor specific symbols and headers in the normal interface.\\nIt also makes it easy to see what code is potentially violating the vendor portability by inspecting the packageâ\\x80\\x99s dependencies to see if one of these\\nros_to_dds\\npackages are being used.\\nType Specific Interfaces\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll along the way there are some parts of the\\nAPIs\\nthat are necessarily specific to the message types being exchanged, e.g. publishing a message or subscribing to a topic, and therefore require generated code for each message type.\\nThe following diagram layouts the path from user defined\\nrosidl\\nfiles, e.g.\\n.msg\\nfiles, to the type specific code used by the user and system to perform type specific functions:\\nFigure: flow chart of â\\x80\\x9cstaticâ\\x80\\x9d type support generation, from\\nrosidl\\nfiles to user facing code.\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe right hand side of the diagram shows how the\\n.msg\\nfiles are passed directly to language specific code generators, e.g.\\nrosidl_generator_cpp\\nor\\nrosidl_generator_py\\n.\\nThese generators are responsible for creating the code that the user will include (or import) and use as the in-memory representation of the messages that were defined in the\\n.msg\\nfiles.\\nFor example, consider the message\\nstd_msgs/String\\n, a user might use this file in C++ with the statement\\n#include\\n<std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>\\n, or they might use the statement\\nfrom\\nstd_msgs.msg\\nimport\\nString\\nin Python.\\nThese statements work because of the files generated by these language specific (but middleware agnostic) generator packages.\\nSeparately, the\\n.msg\\nfiles are used to generate type support code for each type.\\nIn this context, type support means: meta data or functions that are specific to a given type and that are used by the system to perform particular tasks for the given type.\\nThe type support for a given message might include things like a list of the names and types for each field in the message.\\nIt might also contain a reference to code that can perform particular tasks for that type, e.g. publish a message.\\nStatic Type Support\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen the type support references code to do particular functions for a specific message type, that code sometimes needs to do middleware specific work.\\nFor example, consider the type specific publish function, when using â\\x80\\x9cvendor Aâ\\x80\\x9d the function will need to call some of â\\x80\\x9cvendor Aâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98s\\nAPI\\n, but when using â\\x80\\x9cvendor Bâ\\x80\\x9d it will need to call â\\x80\\x9cvendor Bâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98s\\nAPI\\n.\\nTo allow for middleware vendor specific code, the user defined\\n.msg\\nfiles may result in the generation of vendor specific code.\\nThis vendor specific code is still hidden from the user through the type support abstraction, which is similar to how the â\\x80\\x9cPrivate Implementationâ\\x80\\x9d (or Pimpl) pattern works.\\nStatic Type Support with DDS\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nFor middleware vendors based on DDS, and specifically those which generate code based on the OMG IDL files (\\n.idl\\nfiles), the user defined\\nrosidl\\nfiles (\\n.msg\\nfiles) are converted into equivalent OMG IDL files (\\n.idl\\nfiles).\\nFrom these OMG IDL files, vendor specific code is created and then used within the type specific functions which are referenced by the type support for a given type.\\nThe above diagram shows this on the left hand side, where the\\n.msg\\nfiles are consumed by the\\nrosidl_dds\\npackage to produce\\n.idl\\nfiles, and then those\\n.idl\\nfiles are given to language specific and DDS vendor specific type support generation packages.\\nFor example, consider the Fast DDS implementation, which has a package called\\nrosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_cpp\\n.\\nThis package is responsible for generating code to handle things like converting a C++ message object into a serialized octet buffer to be written over the network.\\nThis code, while specific to Fast DDS, is still not exposed to the user because of the abstraction in the type support code.\\nDynamic Type Support\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAnother way to implement type support is to have generic functions for things like publishing to a topic, rather than generating a version of the function for each message type.\\nIn order to accomplish this, this generic function needs some meta information about the message type being published, things like a list of field names and types in the order in which they appear in the message type.\\nThen to publish a message, you call a generic publish function and pass a message to be published along with a structure which contains the necessary meta data about the message type.\\nThis is referred to as â\\x80\\x9cdynamicâ\\x80\\x9d type support, as opposed to â\\x80\\x9cstaticâ\\x80\\x9d type support which requires generated versions of a function for each type.\\nFigure: flow chart of â\\x80\\x9cdynamicâ\\x80\\x9d type support generation, from\\nrosidl\\nfiles to user facing code.\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe above diagram shows the flow from user defined\\nrosidl\\nfiles to generated user facing code.\\nIt is very similar to the diagram for static type support, and differs only in how the type support is generated which is represented by the left hand side of the diagram.\\nIn dynamic type support the\\n.msg\\nfiles are converted directly into user facing code.\\nThis code is also middleware agnostic, because it only contains meta information about the messages.\\nThe function to actually do the work, e.g. publishing to a topic, is generic to the message type and will make any necessary calls to the middleware specific\\nAPIs\\n.\\nNote that rather than dds vendor specific packages providing the type support code, which is the case in static type support, this method has middleware agnostic package for each language, e.g.\\nrosidl_typesupport_introspection_c\\nand\\nrosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp\\n.\\nThe\\nintrospection\\npart of the package name refers to the ability to introspect any message instance with the generated meta data for the message type.\\nThis is the fundamental capability that allows for generic implementations of functions like â\\x80\\x9cpublish to a topicâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nThis approach has the advantage that all generated code is middleware agnostic, which means it can be reused for different middleware implementations, so long as they allow for dynamic type support.\\nIt also results in less generated code, which reduces compile time and code size.\\nHowever, dynamic type support requires that the underlying middleware support a similar form of dynamic type support.\\nIn the case of DDS the DDS-XTypes standard allows for publishing of messages using meta information rather than generated code.\\nDDS-XTypes, or something like it, is required in the underlying middleware in order to support dynamic type support.\\nAlso, this approach to type support is normally slower than the static type support alternative.\\nThe type specific generated code in static type support can be written to be more efficient as it does not need to iterate over the message typeâ\\x80\\x99s meta data to perform things like serialization.\\nThe\\nrcl\\nRepository\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS Client Library interface (\\nrcl\\nAPI\\n) can be used by\\nclient libraries\\n(e.g.\\nrclc\\n,\\nrclcpp\\n,\\nrclpy\\n, etc.) in order to avoid duplicating logic and features.\\nBy reusing the\\nrcl\\nAPI\\n, client libraries can be smaller and more consistent with each other.\\nSome parts of the client library are intentionally left out of the\\nrcl\\nAPI\\nbecause the language idiomatic method should be used to implement those parts of the system.\\nA good example of this is the execution model, which\\nrcl\\ndoes not address at all.\\nInstead the client library should provide a language idiomatic solution like\\npthreads\\nin C,\\nstd::thread\\nin C++11, and\\nthreading.Thread\\nin Python.\\nGenerally the\\nrcl\\ninterface provides functions that are not specific to a language pattern and are not specific to a particular message type.\\nThe\\nrcl\\nAPI\\nis located in the\\nros2/rcl\\nrepository on\\nGitHub\\nand contains the interface as C headers.\\nThe\\nrcl\\nC implementation is provided by the\\nrcl\\npackage\\nin the same repository.\\nThis implementation avoids direct contact with the middleware by instead using the\\nrmw\\nand\\nrosidl\\nAPIs\\n.\\nFor a complete definition of the\\nrcl\\nAPI\\n, see its\\nAPI documentation\\n:\\nThe\\nrmw\\nRepository\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS middleware interface (\\nrmw\\nAPI\\n) is the minimal set of primitive middleware capabilities needed to build ROS on top.\\nProviders of different middleware implementations must implement this interface in order to support the entire ROS stack on top.\\nCurrently all of the middleware implementations are for different DDS vendors.\\nThe\\nrmw\\nAPI\\nis located in the\\nros2/rmw\\nrepository.\\nThe\\nrmw\\npackage\\ncontains the C headers which define the interface, the implementation of which is provided by the various\\npackages\\nof rmw implementations for different DDS vendors.\\nFor a definition of the\\nrmw\\nAPI\\n, see the\\nAPI\\ndocs:\\napi/rmw/index.html\\nThe\\nrosidl\\nRepository\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\nrosidl\\nAPI\\nconsists of a few message related static functions and types along with a definition of what code should be generated by messages in different languages.\\nThe generated message code specified in the\\nAPI\\nwill be language specific, but may or may not reuse generated code for other languages.\\nThe generated message code specified in the\\nAPI\\ncontains things like the message data structure, functions for construction, destruction, etc.\\nThe\\nAPI\\nwill also implement a way to get the type support structure for the message type, which is used when publishing or subscribing to a topic of that message type.\\nThere are several repositories that play a role in the\\nrosidl\\nAPI\\nand implementation.\\nThe\\nrosidl\\nrepository, located on\\nGitHub\\nat\\nros2/rosidl\\n, defines the message IDL syntax, i.e. syntax of\\n.msg\\nfiles,\\n.srv\\nfiles, etc., and contains\\npackages\\nfor parsing the files, for providing CMake infrastructure to generate code from the messages, for generating implementation agnostic code (headers and source files), and for establishing the default set of generators.\\nThe repository contains these\\npackages\\n:\\nrosidl_cmake\\n: provides CMake functions and CMake Modules for generating code from\\nrosidl\\nfiles, e.g.\\n.msg\\nfiles,\\n.srv\\nfiles, etc.\\nrosidl_default_generators\\n: defines the list of default generators which ensures that they are installed as dependencies, but other injected generators can also be used.\\nrosidl_generator_c\\n: provides tools to generate C header files (\\n.h\\n) for\\nrosidl\\nfiles.\\nrosidl_generator_cpp\\n: provides tools to generate C++ header files (\\n.hpp\\n) for\\nrosidl\\nfiles.\\nrosidl_generator_py\\n: provides tools to generate Python modules for\\nrosidl\\nfiles.\\nrosidl_parser\\n: provides Python\\nAPI\\nfor parsing\\nrosidl\\nfiles.\\nGenerators for other languages, e.g.\\nrosidl_generator_java\\n, are hosted externally (in different repositories) but would use the same mechanism that the above generators use to â\\x80\\x9cregisterâ\\x80\\x9d themselves as a\\nrosidl\\ngenerator.\\nIn addition to the aforementioned\\npackages\\nfor parsing and generating headers for the\\nrosidl\\nfiles, the\\nrosidl\\nrepository also contains\\npackages\\nconcerned with â\\x80\\x9ctype supportâ\\x80\\x9d for the message types defined in the files.\\nType support refers to the ability to interpret and manipulate the information represented by ROS message instances of particular types (publishing the messages, for example).\\nType support can either be provided by code that is generated at compile time or it can be done programmatically based on the contents of the\\nrosidl\\nfile, e.g. the\\n.msg\\nor\\n.srv\\nfile, and the data received, by introspecting the data.\\nIn the case of the latter, where type support is done through runtime interpretation of the messages, the message code generated by ROS 2 can be agnostic to the rmw implementation.\\nThe packages that provide this type support through introspection of the data are:\\nrosidl_typesupport_introspection_c\\n: provides tools for generating C code for supporting\\nrosidl\\nmessage data types.\\nrosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp\\n: provides tools for generating C++ code for supporting\\nrosidl\\nmessage data types.\\nIn the case where type support is to be generated at compile time instead of being generated programmatically, a package specific to the rmw implementation will need to be used.\\nThis is because typically a particular rmw implementation will require data to be stored and manipulated in a manner that is specific to the DDS vendor in order for the DDS implementation to make use of it.\\nSee the\\nType Specific Interfaces\\nsection above for more details.\\nFor more information on what exactly is in the\\nrosidl\\nAPI\\n(static and generated) see this page:\\nWarning\\nTODO:

employ when developing ROS 2.\\nGeneral Principles\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSome principles are common to all ROS 2 development:\\nShared ownership\\n:\\nEverybody working on ROS 2 should feel ownership over all parts of the system.\\nThe original author of a chunk of code does not have any special permission or obligation to control or maintain that chunk of code.\\nEveryone is free to propose changes anywhere, to handle any type of ticket, and to review any pull request.\\nBe willing to work on anything\\n:\\nAs a corollary to shared ownership, everybody should be willing to take on any available task and contribute to any aspect of the system.\\nAsk for help\\n:\\nIf you run into trouble on something, ask your fellow developers for help, via tickets, comments, or email, as appropriate.\\nQuality Practices\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nPackages can ascribe to different levels of quality based on the development practices they adhere to, as per the guidelines in\\nREP 2004: Package Quality Categories\\n.\\nThe categories are differentiated by their policies on versioning, testing, documentation, and more.\\nThe following sections are the specific development rules we follow to ensure core packages are of the highest quality (â\\x80\\x98Level 1â\\x80\\x99).\\nWe recommend all ROS developers strive to adhere to the following policies to ensure quality across the ROS ecosystem.\\nVersioning\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe will use the\\nSemantic Versioning guidelines\\n(\\nsemver\\n) for versioning.\\nWe will also adhere to some ROS-specific rules built on top of\\nsemver\\'s\\nfull meaning:\\nMajor version increments (i.e. breaking changes) should not be made within a released ROS distribution.\\nPatch (interface-preserving) and minor (non-breaking) version increments do not break compatibility, so these sorts of changes\\nare\\nallowed within a release.\\nMajor ROS releases are the best time to release breaking changes.\\nIf a core package needs multiple breaking changes, they should be merged into their integration branch (e.g. rolling) to allow catching problems in CI quickly, but released together to reduce the number of major releases for ROS users.\\nThough major increments require a new distribution, a new distribution does not necessarily require a major bump (if development and release can happen without breaking API).\\nFor compiled code, the ABI is considered part of the public interface.\\nAny change that requires recompiling dependent code is considered major (breaking).\\nABI breaking changes\\ncan\\nbe made in a minor version bump\\nbefore\\na distribution release (getting added to the rolling release).\\nWe enforce API stability for core packages in Dashing and Eloquent even though their major version components are\\n0\\n, despite\\nSemVerâ\\x80\\x99s specification\\nregarding initial development.\\nSubsequently, packages should strive to reach a mature state and increase to version\\n1.0.0\\nso to match\\nsemver\\'s\\nspecifications.\\nCaveats\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThese rules are\\nbest-effort\\n.\\nIn unlikely, extreme cases, it may be necessary to break API within a major version/distribution.\\nWhether an unplanned break increments the major or minor version will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\\nFor example, consider a situation involving released X-turtle, corresponding to major version\\n1.0.0\\n, and released Y-turtle, corresponding to major version\\n2.0.0\\n.\\nIf an API-breaking fix is identified to be absolutely necessary in X-turtle, bumping to\\n2.0.0\\nis obviously not an option because\\n2.0.0\\nalready exists.\\nThe solutions for handling X-turtleâ\\x80\\x99s version in such a case, both non-ideal, are:\\nBumping X-turtleâ\\x80\\x99s minor version: non-ideal because it violates SemVerâ\\x80\\x99s principle that breaking changes must bump the major version.\\nBumping X-turtleâ\\x80\\x99s major version past Y-turtle (to\\n3.0.0\\n): non-ideal because the older distroâ\\x80\\x99s version would become higher than the already-available version of a newer distro, which would invalidate/break version-specific conditional code.\\nThe developer will have to decide which solution to use, or more importantly, which principle they are willing to break.\\nWe cannot suggest one or the other, but in either case we do require that explicit measures be taken to communicate the disruption and its explanation to users manually (beyond just the version increment).\\nIf there were no Y-turtle, even though the fix would technically just be a patch, X-turtle would have to bump to\\n2.0.0\\n.\\nThis case adheres to SemVer, but breaks from our own rule that major increments should not be introduced in a released distribution.\\nThis is why we consider the versioning rules\\nbest-effort\\n.\\nAs unlikely as the examples above are, it is important to accurately define our versioning system.\\nPublic API declaration\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAccording to\\nsemver\\n, every package must clearly declare a public API.\\nWe will use the â\\x80\\x9cPublic API Declarationâ\\x80\\x9d section of the quality declaration of a package to declare what symbols are part of the public API.\\nFor most C and C++ packages the declaration is any header that it installs.\\nHowever, it is acceptable to define a set of symbols which are considered private.\\nAvoiding private symbols in headers can help with ABI stability, but is not required.\\nFor other languages like Python, a public API must be explicitly defined, so that it is clear what symbols can be relied on with respect to the versioning guidelines.\\nThe public API can also be extended to build artifacts like configuration variables, CMake config files, etc. as well as executables and command-line options and output.\\nAny elements of the public API should be clearly stated in the packageâ\\x80\\x99s documentation.\\nIf something you are using is not explicitly listed as part of the public API in the packageâ\\x80\\x99s documentation, then you cannot depend on it not changing between minor or patch versions.\\nDeprecation strategy\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhere possible, we will also use the tick-tock deprecation and migration strategy for major version increments.\\nNew deprecations will come in a new distribution release, accompanied by compiler warnings expressing that the functionality is being deprecated.\\nIn the next release, the functionality will be completely removed (no warnings).\\nExample of function\\nfoo\\ndeprecated and replaced by function\\nbar\\n:\\nVersion\\nAPI\\nX-turtle\\nvoid foo();\\nY-turtle\\n[[deprecated(â\\x80\\x9cuse bar()â\\x80\\x9d)]] void foo(); <br> void bar();\\nZ-turtle\\nvoid bar();\\nWe must not add deprecations after a distribution is released.\\nDeprecations do not necessarily require a major version bump, though.\\nA deprecation can be introduced in a minor version bump if the bump happens before the distro is released (similar to ABI breaking changes).\\nFor example, if X-turtle begins development as\\n2.0.0\\n, a deprecation can be added in\\n2.1.0\\nbefore X-turtle is released.\\nWe will attempt to maintain compatibility across distros as much as possible.\\nHowever, like the caveats associated with SemVer, tick-tock or even deprecation in general may be impossible to completely adhere to in certain cases.\\nChange control process\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll changes must go through a pull request.\\nWe will enforce the\\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin (DCO)\\non pull requests in ROSCore repositories.\\nIt requires all commit messages to contain the\\nSigned-off-by\\nline with an email address that matches the commit author.\\nYou can pass\\n-s\\n/\\n--signoff\\nto the\\ngit\\ncommit\\ninvocation or write the expected message manually (e.g.\\nSigned-off-by:\\nYour\\nName\\nDeveloper\\n<your.name@example.com>\\n).\\nDCO is\\nnot\\nrequired for pull requests that only address whitespace removal, typo correction, and other\\ntrivial changes\\n.\\nAlways run CI jobs for all\\ntier 1 platforms\\nfor every pull request and include links to jobs in the pull request.\\n(If you donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to the Jenkins jobs someone will trigger the jobs for you.)\\nA minimum of 1 approval from a fellow developer who did not author the pull request is required to consider it approved.\\nApproval is required before merging.\\nPackages may choose to increase this number.\\nAny required changes to documentation (API documentation, feature documentation, release notes, etc.) must be proposed before merging related changes.\\nGuidelines for backporting PRs\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen changing an older version of ROS:\\nMake sure the features or fixes are accepted and merged in the rolling branch before opening a PR to backport the changes to older versions.\\nWhen backporting to older versions, also consider backporting to any other\\nstill supported versions\\n, even non-LTS versions.\\nIf you are backporting a single PR in its entirety, title the backport PR â\\x80\\x9c[Distro] <name of original PR>â\\x80\\x9d.\\nIf backporting a subset of changes from one or multiple PRs, the title should be â\\x80\\x9c[Distro] <description of changes>â\\x80\\x9d.\\nLink to all PRs whose changes youâ\\x80\\x99re backporting from the description of your backport PR.\\nIn a Dashing backport of a Foxy change, you do not need to link to the Eloquent backport of the same change.\\nDocumentation\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll packages should have these documentation elements present in their README or linked to from their README:\\nDescription and purpose\\nDefinition and description of the public API\\nExamples\\nHow to build and install (should reference external tools/workflows)\\nHow to build and run tests\\nHow to build documentation\\nHow to develop (useful for describing things like\\npython\\nsetup.py\\ndevelop\\n)\\nLicense and copyright statements\\nEach source file must have a license and copyright statement, checked with an automated linter.\\nEach package must have a LICENSE file, typically the Apache 2.0 license, unless the package has an existing permissive license (e.g. rviz uses three-clause BSD).\\nEach package should describe itself and its purpose assuming, as much as possible, that the reader has stumbled onto it without previous knowledge of ROS or other related projects.\\nEach package should define and describe its public API so that there is a reasonable expectation for users about what is covered by the semantic versioning policy.\\nEven in C and C++, where the public API can be enforced by API and ABI checking, it is a good opportunity to describe the layout of the code and the function of each part of the code.\\nIt should be easy to take any package and from that packageâ\\x80\\x99s documentation understand how to build, run, build and run tests, and build the documentation.\\nObviously we should avoid repeating ourselves for common workflows, like building a package in a workspace, but the basic workflows should be either described or referenced.\\nFinally, it should include any documentation for developers.\\nThis might include workflows for testing the code using something like\\npython\\nsetup.py\\ndevelop\\n, or it might mean describing how to make use of extension points provided by your package.\\nExamples:\\ncapabilities:\\nhttps://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/capabilities/html/\\nThis one gives an example of docs which describe the public API\\ncatkin_tools:\\nhttps://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/extending_the_catkin_command.html\\nThis is an example of describing an extension point for a package\\n(API docs are not yet being automatically generated)\\nTesting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAll packages should have some level of\\nsystem, integration, and/or unit tests.\\nUnit tests\\nshould always be in the package which is being tested and should make use of tools like\\nMock\\nto try and test narrow parts of the code base in constructed scenarios.\\nUnit tests should not bring in test dependencies that are not testing tools, e.g. gtest, nosetest, pytest, mock, etcâ\\x80¦\\nIntegration tests\\ncan test interactions between parts of the code or between parts of the code and the system.\\nThey often test software interfaces in ways that we expect the user to use them.\\nLike Unit tests, Integration tests should be in the package which is being tested and should not bring in non-tool test dependencies unless absolutely necessary, i.e. all non-tool dependencies should only be allowed under extreme scrutiny so they should be avoided if possible.\\nSystem tests\\nare designed to test end-to-end situations between packages and should be in their own packages to avoid bloating or coupling packages and to avoid circular dependencies.\\nIn general minimizing external or cross package test dependencies should be avoided to prevent circular dependencies and tightly coupled test packages.\\nAll packages should have some unit tests and possibly integration tests, but the degree to which they should have them is based on the packageâ\\x80\\x99s quality category.\\nThe following subsections apply to â\\x80\\x98Level 1â\\x80\\x99 packages:\\nCode coverage\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe will provide line coverage, and achieve line coverage above 95%.\\nIf a lower percentage target is justifiable, it must be prominently documented.\\nWe may provide branch coverage, or exclude code from coverage (test code, debug code, etc.).\\nWe require that coverage increase or stay the same before merging a change, but it may be acceptable to make a change that decreases code coverage with proper justification (e.g. deleting code that was previously covered can cause the percentage to drop).\\nPerformance\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe strongly recommend performance tests, but recognize they donâ\\x80\\x99t make sense for some packages.\\nIf there are performance tests, we will choose to either check each change or before each release or both.\\nWe will also require justification for merging a change or making a release that lowers performance.\\nLinters and static analysis\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe will use\\nROS code style\\nand enforce it with linters from\\nament_lint_common\\n.\\nAll linters/static analysis that are part of\\nament_lint_common\\nmust be used.\\nThe\\nament_lint_auto\\ndocumentation provides information on running\\nament_lint_common\\n.\\nGeneral Practices\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSome practices are common to all ROS 2 development.\\nThese practices donâ\\x80\\x99t affect package quality level as described in\\nREP 2004\\n, but are still highly recommended for the development process.\\nIssues\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen filing an issue please make sure to:\\nInclude enough information for another person to understand the issue.\\nIn ROS 2, the following points are needed for narrowing down the cause of an issue.\\nTesting with as many alternatives in each category as feasible will be especially helpful.\\nThe operating system and version.\\nReasoning: ROS 2 supports multiple platforms, and some bugs are specific to particular versions of operating systems/compilers.\\nThe installation method.\\nReasoning: Some issues only manifest if ROS 2 has been installed from â\\x80\\x9cfat archivesâ\\x80\\x9d or from Debians.\\nThis can help us determine if the issue is with the packaging process.\\nThe specific version of ROS 2.\\nReasoning: Some bugs may be present in a particular ROS 2 release and later fixed.\\nIt is important to know if your installation includes these fixes.\\nThe DDS/RMW implementation being used\\n(see\\nthis page\\nfor how to determine which one).\\nReasoning: Communication issues may be specific to the underlying ROS middleware being used.\\nThe ROS 2 client library being used.\\nReasoning: This helps us narrow down the layer in the stack at which the issue might be.\\nInclude a list of steps to reproduce the issue.\\nIn case of a bug consider to provide a\\nshort, self contained, correct (compilable), example\\n.\\nIssues are much more likely to be resolved if others can reproduce them easily.\\nMention troubleshooting steps that have been tried already, including:\\nUpgrading to the latest version of the code, which may include bug fixes that have not been released yet.\\nSee\\nthis section\\nand follow the instructions to get the â\\x80\\x9crollingâ\\x80\\x9d branches.\\nTrying with a different RMW implementation.\\nSee\\nthis page\\nfor how to do that.\\nBranches\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nNote\\nThese are just guidelines.\\nIt is up to the package maintainer to choose branch names that match their own workflow.\\nIt is good practice to have\\nseparate branches\\nin a packageâ\\x80\\x99s source repository for each ROS distribution it is targeting.\\nThese branches are typically named after the distribution they target.\\nFor example, a\\nhumble\\nbranch for development targeted specifically at the Humble distribution.\\nReleases are also made from these branches, targeting the appropriate distribution.\\nDevelopment targeted at a specific ROS distribution can happen on the appropriate branch.\\nFor example: Development commits targeting\\nfoxy\\nare made to the\\nfoxy\\nbranch, and package releases for\\nfoxy\\nare made from that same branch.\\nNote\\nThis requires the package maintainers to perform backports or forwardports as appropriate to keep all branches up to date with features.\\nThe maintainers must also perform general maintenance (bug fixes, etc.) on all branches from which package releases are still made.\\nFor example, if a feature is merged into the Rolling-specific branch (e.g.\\nrolling\\nor\\nmain\\n), and that feature is also appropriate\\nto the Galactic distribution (does not break API, etc.), then it is good practice to backport the feature to the Galactic-specific branch.\\nThe maintainers may make releases for those older distributions if there are new features or bug fixes available.\\nWhat about\\nmain\\nand\\nrolling\\n?\\nmain\\ntypically targets\\nRolling\\n(and so, the next unreleased ROS distribution), though the maintainers may decide to develop and release from a\\nrolling\\nbranch instead.\\nPull requests\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA pull request should only focus on one change.\\nSeparate changes should go into separate pull requests.\\nSee\\nGitHubâ\\x80\\x99s guide to writing the perfect pull request\\n.\\nA patch should be minimal in size and avoid any kind of unnecessary changes.\\nA pull request must contain minimum number of meaningful commits.\\nYou can create new commits while the pull request is under review.\\nBefore merging a pull request all changes should be squashed into a small number of semantic commits to keep the history clear.\\nBut avoid squashing commits while a pull request is under review.\\nYour reviewers might not notice that you made the change, thereby introducing potential for confusion.\\nPlus, youâ\\x80\\x99re going to squash before merging anyway; thereâ\\x80\\x99s no benefit to doing it early.\\nAny developer is welcome to review and approve a pull request (see\\nGeneral Principles\\n).\\nWhen you start reviewing a pull request, comment on the pull request so that other developers know that youâ\\x80\\x99re reviewing it.\\nPull-request review is not read-only, with the reviewer making comments and then waiting for the author to address them.\\nAs a reviewer, feel free to make minor improvements (typos, style issues, etc.) in-place.\\nAs the opener of a pull-request, if you are working in a fork, checking the box to\\nallow edits from upstream contributors\\nwill assist with the aforementioned.\\nAs a reviewer, also feel free to make more substantial improvements, but consider putting them in a separate branch (either mention the new branch in a comment, or open another pull request from the new branch to the original branch).\\nAny developer (the author, the reviewer, or somebody else) can merge any approved pull request.\\nLibrary versioning\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe will version all libraries within a package together.\\nThis means that libraries inherit their version from the package.\\nThis keeps library and package versions from diverging and shares reasoning with the policy of releasing packages which share a repository together.\\nIf you need libraries to have different versions then consider splitting them into different packages.\\nDevelopment process\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe default branch (in most cases the rolling branch) must always build, pass all tests and compile without warnings.\\nIf at any time there is a regression it is the top priority to restore at least the previous state.\\nAlways build with tests enabled.\\nAlways run tests locally after changes and before proposing them in a pull request.\\nBesides using automated tests, also run the modified code path manually to ensure that the patch works as intended.\\nAlways run CI jobs for all platforms for every pull request and include links to the jobs in the pull request.\\nFor more details on recommended software development workflow, see\\nSoftware Development Lifecycle\\nsection.\\nChanges to RMW API\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen updating\\nRMW API\\n, it is required that RMW implementations for the Tier 1 middleware libraries are updated as well.\\nFor example, a new function\\nrmw_foo()\\nintroduced to the RMW API must be implemented in the following packages (as of ROS Galactic):\\nrmw_connextdds\\nrmw_cyclonedds\\nrmw_fastrtps\\nUpdates for non-Tier 1 middleware libraries should also be considered if feasible (e.g. depending on the size of the change).\\nSee\\nREP-2000\\nfor the list of middleware libraries and their tiers.\\nTracking tasks\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo help organize work on ROS 2, the core ROS 2 development team uses kanban-style\\nGitHub project boards\\n.\\nNot all issues and pull requests are tracked on the project boards, however.\\nA board usually represents an upcoming release or specific project.\\nTickets can be browsed on a per-repo basis by browsing the\\nROS 2 repositoriesâ\\x80\\x99\\nindividual issue pages.\\nThe names and purposes of columns in any given ROS 2 project board vary, but typically follow the same general structure:\\nTo do\\n:\\nIssues that are relevant to the project, ready to be assigned\\nIn progress\\n:\\nActive pull requests on which work is currently in progress\\nIn review\\n:\\nPull requests where work is complete and ready for review, and for those currently under active review\\nDone\\n:\\nPull requests and related issues are merged/closed (for informational purposes)\\nTo request permission to make changes, simply comment on the tickets youâ\\x80\\x99re interested in.\\nDepending on the complexity, it might be useful to describe how you plan to address it.\\nWe will update the status (if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have the permission) and you can start working on a pull request.\\nIf you contribute regularly we will likely just grant you permission to manage the labels etc. yourself.\\nProgramming conventions\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDefensive programming: ensure that assumptions are held as early as possible.\\nE.g. check every return code and make sure to at least throw an exception until the case is handled more gracefully.\\nAll error messages must be directed to\\nstderr\\n.\\nDeclare variables in the narrowest scope possible.\\nKeep group of items (dependencies, imports, includes, etc.) ordered alphabetically.\\nC++ specific\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nAvoid using direct streaming (\\n<<\\n) to\\nstdout\\n/\\nstderr\\nto prevent interleaving between multiple threads.\\nAvoid using references for\\nstd::shared_ptr\\nsince that subverts the reference counting.\\nIf the original instance goes out of scope and the reference is being used it accesses freed memory.\\nFilesystem layout\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe filesystem layout of packages and repositories should follow the same conventions in order to provide a consistent experience for users browsing our source code.\\nPackage layout\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nsrc\\n: contains all C and C++ code\\nAlso contains C/C++ headers which are not installed\\ninclude\\n: contains all C and C++ headers which are installed\\n<package\\nname>\\n: for all C and C++ installed headers they should be folder namespaced by the package name\\n<package_name>\\n: contains all Python code\\ntest\\n: contains all automated tests and test data\\nconfig\\n: contains configuration files, e.g. YAML parameters files and RViz config files\\ndoc\\n: contains all the documentation\\nlaunch\\n: contains all launch files\\npackage.xml\\n: as defined by\\nREP-0140\\n(may be updated for prototyping)\\nCMakeLists.txt\\n: only ROS packages which use CMake\\nsetup.py\\n: only ROS packages which use Python code only\\nREADME\\n: can be rendered on GitHub as a landing page for the project\\nThis can be as short or detailed as is convenient, but it should at least link to project documentation\\nConsider putting a CI or code coverage tag in this README\\nIt can also be\\n.rst\\nor anything else that GitHub supports\\nCONTRIBUTING\\n: describes the contribution guidelines\\nThis might include license implication, e.g. when using the Apache 2 License.\\nLICENSE\\n: a copy of the license or licenses for this package\\nCHANGELOG.rst\\n:\\nREP-0132\\ncompliant changelog\\nRepository layout\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nEach package should be in a subfolder which has the same name as the package.\\nIf a repository contains only a single package it can optionally be in the root of the repository.\\nDeveloper Workflow\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWe track open tickets and active PRs related to upcoming releases and larger projects using\\nGitHub project boards\\n.\\nThe usual workflow is:\\nDiscuss design (GitHub ticket on the appropriate repository, and a design PR to\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/design\\nif needed)\\nWrite implementation on a feature branch on a fork\\nPlease check out the\\ndeveloper guide\\nfor guidelines and best practices\\nWrite tests\\nEnable and run linters\\nRun tests locally using\\ncolcon\\ntest\\n(see the\\ncolcon tutorial\\n)\\nOnce everything builds locally without warnings and all tests are passing, run CI on your feature branch:\\nGo to ci.ros2.org\\nLog in (top right corner)\\nClick on the\\nci_launcher\\njob\\nClick â\\x80\\x9cBuild with Parametersâ\\x80\\x9d (left column)\\nIn the first box â\\x80\\x9cCI_BRANCH_TO_TESTâ\\x80\\x9d enter your feature branch name\\nHit the\\nbuild\\nbutton\\n(if you are not a ROS 2 committer, you donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to the CI farm. In that case, ping the reviewer of your PR to run CI for you)\\nIf your use case requires running code coverage:\\nGo to ci.ros2.org\\nLog in (top right corner)\\nClick on the\\nci_linux_coverage\\njob\\nClick â\\x80\\x9cBuild with Parametersâ\\x80\\x9d (left column)\\nBe sure of leaving â\\x80\\x9cCI_BUILD_ARGSâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cCI_TEST_ARGSâ\\x80\\x9d with the default values\\nHit the\\nbuild\\nbutton\\nAt the end of the document there are instructions on how to\\ninterpret the result of the report\\nand\\ncalculate the coverage rate\\nIf the CI job built without warnings, errors and test failures, post the links of your jobs on your PR or high-level ticket aggregating all your PRs (see example\\nhere\\n)\\nNote that the markdown for these badges is in the console output of the\\nci_launcher\\njob\\nWhen the PR has been approved:\\nthe person who submitted the PR merges it using â\\x80\\x9cSquash and Mergeâ\\x80\\x9d option so that we keep a clean history\\nIf the commits deserve to keep separated: squash all the nitpick/linters/typo ones together and merge the remaining set\\nNote: each PR should target a specific feature so Squash and Merge should make sense 99% of the time\\nDelete the branch once merged\\nArchitectural Development Practices\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis section describes the ideal lifecycle that should be employed when making large architectural changes to ROS 2.\\nSoftware Development Lifecycle\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThis section describes step-by-step how to plan, design, and implement a new feature:\\nTask Creation\\nCreating the Design Document\\nDesign Review\\nImplementation\\nCode Review\\nTask creation\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTasks requiring changes to critical parts of ROS 2 should have design reviews during early stages of the release cycle.\\nIf a design review is happening in the later stages, the changes will be part of a future release.\\nAn issue should be created in the appropriate\\nros2 repository\\n, clearly describing the task being worked on.\\nIt should have a clear success criteria and highlight the concrete improvements expected from it.\\nIf the feature is targeting a ROS release, ensure this is tracked in the ROS release ticket (\\nexample\\n).\\nWriting the design document\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nDesign docs must never include confidential information.\\nWhether or not a design document is required for your change depends on how big the task is.\\nYou are making a small change or fixing a bug:\\nA design document is not required, but an issue should be opened in the appropriate repository to track the work and avoid duplication of efforts.\\nYou are implementing a new feature or would like to contribute to OSRF-owned infrastructure (like Jenkins CI):\\nDesign doc is required and should be contributed to\\nros2/design\\nto be made accessible on\\nhttps://design.ros2.org/\\n.\\nYou should fork the repository and submit a pull request detailing the design.\\nMention the related ros2 issue (for example,\\nDesign\\ndoc\\nfor\\ntask\\nros2/ros2#<issue\\nid>\\n) in the pull request or the commit message.\\nDetailed instructions are on the\\nROS 2 Contribute\\npage.\\nDesign comments will be made directly on the pull request.\\nIf the task is planned to be released with a specific version of ROS, this information should be included in the pull request.\\nDesign document review\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOnce the design is ready for review, a pull request should be opened and appropriate reviewers should be assigned.\\nIt is recommended to include project owner(s) -\\nmaintainers of all impacted packages (as defined by\\npackage.xml\\nmaintainer field, see\\nREP-140\\n) - as reviewers.\\nIf the design doc is complex or reviewers have conflicting schedules, an optional design review meeting can be set up.\\nIn this case,\\nBefore the meeting\\nSend a meeting invite at least one week in advance\\nMeeting duration of one hour is recommended\\nMeeting invite should list all decisions to be made during the review (decisions requiring package maintainer approval)\\nMeeting required attendees: design pull request reviewers\\nMeeting optional attendees: all OSRF engineers, if applicable\\nDuring the meeting\\nThe task owner drives the meeting, presents their ideas and manages discussions to ensure an agreement is reached on time\\nAfter the meeting\\nThe task owner should send back meeting notes to all attendees\\nIf minor issues have been raised about the design:\\nThe task owner should update the design doc pull request based on the feedback\\nAdditional review is not required\\nIf major issues have been raised about the design:\\nIt is acceptable to remove sections for which there is no clear agreement\\nThe debatable parts of the design can be resubmitted as a separate task in the future\\nIf removing the debatable parts is not an option, work directly with package owners to reach an agreement\\nOnce consensus is reached:\\nEnsure the\\nros2/design\\npull request has been merged, if applicable\\nUpdate and close the GitHub issue associated with this design task\\nImplementation\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nBefore starting, go through the\\nPull requests\\nsection for best practices.\\nFor each repo to be modified:\\nModify the code, go to the next step if finished or at regular intervals to backup your work.\\nSelf-review\\nyour changes using\\ngit\\nadd\\n-i\\n.\\nCreate a new signed commit using\\ngit\\ncommit\\n-s\\n.\\nA pull request should contain minimal semantically meaningful commits (for instance, a large number of 1-line commits is not acceptable).\\nCreate new fixup commits while iterating on feedback, or optionally, amend existing commits using\\ngit\\ncommit\\n--amend\\nif you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to create a new commit every time.\\nEach commit must have a properly written, meaningful, commit message.\\nMore instructions\\nhere\\n.\\nMoving files must be done in a separate commit, otherwise git may fail to accurately track the file history.\\nEither the pull request description or the commit message must contain a reference to the related ros2 issue, so it gets automatically closed when the pull request is merged.\\nSee this\\ndoc\\nfor more details.\\nPush the new commits.\\nCode review\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nOnce the change is ready for code review:\\nOpen a pull request for each modified repository.\\nRemember to follow\\nPull requests\\nbest practices.\\nGitHub\\ncan be used to create pull requests from the command-line.\\nIf the task is planned to be released with a specific version of ROS, this information should be included in each pull request.\\nPackage owners who reviewed the design document should be mentioned in the pull request.\\nCode review SLO: although reviewing pull requests is best-effort,\\nit is helpful to have reviewers comment on pull requests within a week and\\ncode authors to reply back to comments within a week, so there is no loss of context.\\nIterate on feedback as usual, amend and update the development branch as needed.\\nOnce the PR is approved, package maintainers will merge the changes in.\\nBuild Farm Introduction\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe build farm is located at\\nci.ros2.org\\n.\\nEvery night we run nightly jobs which build and run all the tests in various scenarios on various platforms.\\nAdditionally, we test all pull requests against these platforms before merging.\\nThis is the current set of target platforms and architectures, though it evolves overtime:\\nUbuntu 20.04 Focal\\namd64\\naarch64\\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave\\namd64\\nWindows 10\\namd64\\nThere are several categories of jobs on the buildfarm:\\nmanual jobs (triggered manually by developers):\\nci_linux: build + test the code on Ubuntu Xenial\\nci_linux-aarch64: build + test the code on Ubuntu Xenial on an ARM 64-bit machine (aarch64)\\nci_linux_coverage: build + test + generation of test coverage\\nci_osx: build + test the code on MacOS 10.12\\nci_windows: build + test the code on Windows 10\\nci_launcher: trigger all the jobs listed above\\nnightly (run every night):\\nDebug: build + test the code with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\\nnightly_linux_debug\\nnightly_linux-aarch64_debug\\nnightly_osx_debug\\nnightly_win_deb\\nRelease: build + test the code with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\\nnightly_linux_release\\nnightly_linux-aarch64_release\\nnightly_osx_release\\nnightly_win_rel\\nRepeated: build then run each test up to 20 times or until failed (aka flakiness hunter)\\nnightly_linux_repeated\\nnightly_linux-aarch64_repeated\\nnightly_osx_repeated\\nnightly_win_rep\\nCoverage:\\nnightly_linux_coverage: build + test the code + analyses coverage for

build farms support the ROS / ROS 2 ecosystem by providing building of source and\\nbinary packages, continuous integration, testing, and analysis.\\nFor details, frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting see\\nbuild farms\\n.\\nNote on Coverage runs\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 packages are organized in a way that the testing code for a given package is not only contained within the package, but could also be present in a different package.\\nIn other words: packages can exercise code belonging to other packages during the testing phase.\\nTo achieve the coverage rate reached by all code available in the ROS 2 core packages it is recommended to run builds using a fixed set of proposed repositories.\\nThat set is defined in the default parameters of coverage jobs in Jenkins.\\nHow to read the coverage rate from the buildfarm report\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo see the coverage report for a given package:\\nWhen the\\nci_linux_coverage\\nbuild finishes, click on\\nCoverage\\nReport\\nScroll down to the\\nCoverage\\nBreakdown\\nby\\nPackage\\ntable\\nIn the table, look at the first column called â\\x80\\x9cNameâ\\x80\\x9d\\nThe coverage reports in the buildfarm include all the packages that were used in the ROS workspace.\\nThe coverage report includes different paths corresponding to the same package:\\nName entries with the form:\\nsrc.*.<repository_name>.<package_name>.*\\nThese correspond to the unit test runs available in a package against its own source code\\nName entries with the form:\\nbuild.<repository_name>.<package_name>.*\\nThese correspond to the unit test runs available in a package against its files generated at building or configuring time\\nName entries with the form:\\ninstall.<package_name>.*\\nThese correspond to the system/integration tests coming from testing runs of other packages\\nHow to calculate the coverage rate from the buildfarm report\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nGet the combined unit coverage rate using the automatic script:\\nFrom the ci_linux_coverage Jenkins build copy the URL of the build\\nDownload the\\nget_coverage_ros2_pkg\\nscript\\nExecute the script:\\n./get_coverage_ros2_pkg.py\\n<jenkins_build_url>\\n<ros2_package_name>\\n(\\nREADME\\n)\\nGrab the results from the â\\x80\\x9cCombined unit testingâ\\x80\\x9d final line in the output of the script\\nAlternative: get the combined unit coverage rate from coverage report (require manual calculation):\\nWhen the ci_linux_coverage build finishes, click on\\nCobertura\\nCoverage\\nReport\\nScroll down to the\\nCoverage\\nBreakdown\\nby\\nPackage\\ntable\\nIn the table, under the first column â\\x80\\x9cNameâ\\x80\\x9d, look for (where <package_name> is your package under testing):\\nall the directories under the pattern\\nsrc.*.<repository_name>.<package_name>.*\\ngrab the two absolute values in the column â\\x80\\x9cLinesâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nall the directories under the pattern\\nbuild/.<repository_name>.*\\ngrab the two absolute values in the column â\\x80\\x9cLinesâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nWith the previous selection: for each cell, the first value is the lines tested and the second is the total lines of code.\\nAggregate all rows for getting the total of the lines tested and the total of lines of code under test.\\nDivide to get the coverage rate.\\nHow to measure coverage locally using lcov (Ubuntu)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo measure coverage on your own machine, install\\nlcov\\n.\\nsudo\\napt\\ninstall\\n-y\\nlcov\\nThe rest of this section

These annotations are Clang-specific attributes - e.g.\\n__attribute__(capability()))\\n. Instead of using those attributes directly, ROS 2 provides preprocessor macros that are erased when using other compilers.\\nThese macros can be found in\\nrcpputils/thread_safety_annotations.hpp\\nThe Thread Safety Analysis documentation states\\nThread safety analysis can be used with any threading library, but it does require that the threading API be wrapped in classes and methods which have the appropriate annotations\\nWe have decided that we want ROS 2 developers to be able to use\\nstd::\\nthreading primitives directly for their development. We do not want to provide our own wrapped types as is suggested above.\\nThere are three C++ standard libraries to be aware of\\n* The GNU standard library\\nlibstdc++\\n- default on Linux, explicitly via the compiler option\\n-stdlib=libstdc++\\n* The LLVM standard library\\nlibc++\\n(also called\\nlibcxx\\n) - default on macOS,  explicitly set by the compiler option\\n-stdlib=libc++\\n* The Windows C++ Standard Library - not relevant to this use case\\nlibcxx\\nannotates its\\nstd::mutex\\nand\\nstd::lock_guard\\nimplementations for Thread Safety Analysis. When using GNU\\nlibstdc++\\n, those annotations are not present, so Thread Safety Analysis cannot be used on non-wrapped\\nstd::\\ntypes.\\nTherefore, to use Thread Safety Analysis directly with\\nstd::\\ntypes, we must use\\nlibcxx\\nImplementation:\\nThe code migration suggestions here are by no means complete - when writing (or annotating existing) threaded code, you are encouraged to utilize as many of the annotations as is logical for your use case. However, this step-by-step is a great place to start!\\nEnabling Analysis for Package/Target\\nWhen the C++ compiler is Clang, enable the\\n-Wthread-safety\\nflag. Example below for CMake-based projects\\nif\\n(\\nCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID\\nMATCHES\\n\"Clang\"\\n)\\nadd_compile_options\\n(\\n-Wthread-safety\\n)\\n# for your whole package\\ntarget_compile_options\\n(\\n${\\nMY_TARGET\\n}\\nPUBLIC\\n-Wthread-safety\\n)\\n# for a single library or executable\\nendif\\n()\\nAnnotating Code\\nStep 1 - Annotate data members\\nFind anywhere that\\nstd::mutex\\nis used to protect some member data\\nAdd the\\nRCPPUTILS_TSA_GUARDED_BY(mutex_name)\\nannotation to the data that is protected by the mutex\\nclass\\nFoo\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nvoid\\nincr\\n(\\nint\\namount\\n)\\n{\\nstd\\n::\\nlock_guard\\n<\\nstd\\n::\\nmutex\\n>\\nlock\\n(\\nmutex_\\n);\\nbar\\n+=\\namount\\n;\\n}\\nvoid\\nget\\n()\\nconst\\n{\\nreturn\\nbar\\n;\\n}\\nprivate\\n:\\nmutable\\nstd\\n::\\nmutex\\nmutex_\\n;\\nint\\nbar\\nRCPPUTILS_TSA_GUARDED_BY\\n(\\nmutex_\\n)\\n=\\n0\\n;\\n};\\nStep 2 - Fix Warnings\\nIn the above example -\\nFoo::get\\nwill produce a compiler warning! To fix it, lock before returning bar\\nvoid\\nget\\n()\\nconst\\n{\\nstd\\n::\\nlock_guard\\n<\\nstd\\n::\\nmutex\\n>\\nlock\\n(\\nmutex_\\n);\\nreturn\\nbar\\n;\\n}\\nStep 3 - (Optional but Recommended) Refactor Existing Code to Private-Mutex Pattern\\nA recommended pattern in threaded C++ code is to always keep your\\nmutex\\nas a\\nprivate:\\nmember of the data structure. This makes data safety the concern of the containing structure, offloading that responsibility from users of the structure and minimizing the surface area of affected code.\\nMaking your locks private may require rethinking the interfaces to your data. This is a great exercise - here are a few things to consider\\nYou may want to provide specialized interfaces for performing analysis that requires complex locking logic, e.g. counting members in a filtered set of a mutex-guarded map structure, instead of actually returning the underlying structure to consumers\\nConsider copying to avoid blocking, where the amount of data is small. This can let other threads get on with accessing the shared data, which can potentially lead to better overall performance.\\nStep 4 - (Optional) Enable Negative Capability Analysis\\nhttps://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#negative-capabilities\\nNegative Capability Analysis lets you specify â\\x80\\x9cthis lock must not be held when calling this functionâ\\x80\\x9d. It can reveal potential deadlock cases that other annotations cannot.\\nWhere you specified\\n-Wthread-safety\\n, add the additional flag\\n-Wthread-safety-negative\\nOn any function that acquires a lock, use the\\nRCPPUTILS_TSA_REQUIRES(!mutex)\\npattern\\nHow to run the analysis\\nThe ROS CI build farm runs a nightly job with\\nlibcxx\\n, which will surface any issues in the ROS 2 core stack by being marked â\\x80\\x9cUnstableâ\\x80\\x9d when Thread Safety Analysis raises warnings\\nFor local runs, you have the following options, all equivalent\\nUse the colcon\\nclang-libcxx mixin\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n--mixin\\nclang-libcxx\\nYou may only use this if you have\\nconfigured mixins for your colcon installation\\nPassing compiler to CMake\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n--cmake-args\\n-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang\\n-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++\\n-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\\'-stdlib=libc++\\n-D_LIBCPP_ENABLE_THREAD_SAFETY_ANNOTATIONS\\'\\n-DFORCE_BUILD_VENDOR_PKG=ON\\n--no-warn-unused-cli\\nOverriding system compiler\\nCC=clang\\nCXX=clang++\\ncolcon\\nbuild\\n--cmake-args\\n-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\\'-stdlib=libc++\\n-D_LIBCPP_ENABLE_THREAD_SAFETY_ANNOTATIONS\\'\\n-DFORCE_BUILD_VENDOR_PKG=ON\\n--no-warn-unused-cli\\nResulting Context:\\nPotential deadlocks and race conditions will be surfaced at compile time, when using Clang and\\nlibcxx\\nDynamic analysis (data races & deadlocks)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nContext:\\nYou are developing/debugging your multithreaded C++ production code.\\nYou use pthreads or C++11 threading + llvm libc++ (in case of ThreadSanitizer).\\nYou do not use Libc/libstdc++ static linking (in case of ThreadSanitizer).\\nYou do not build non-position-independent executables (in case of ThreadSanitizer).\\nProblem:\\nData races and deadlocks can lead to critical bugs.\\nData races and deadlocks cannot be detected using static analysis (reason: limitation of static analysis).\\nData races and deadlocks must not show up during development debugging / testing (reason: usually not all possible control paths through production code exercised).\\nSolution:\\nUse a dynamic analysis tool which focuses on finding data races and deadlocks (here clang ThreadSanitizer).\\nImplementation:\\nCompile and link the production code with clang using the option\\n-fsanitize=thread\\n(this instruments the production code).\\nIn case different production code shall be executed during analysis consider conditional compilation e.g.\\nThreadSanitizers _has_feature(thread_sanitizer)\\n.\\nIn case some code shall not be instrumented consider\\nThreadSanitizers _/*attribute*/_((no_sanitize(â\\x80\\x9cthreadâ\\x80\\x9d)))\\n.\\nIn case some files shall not be instrumented consider file or function-level exclusion\\nThreadSanitizers blacklisting\\n, more specific:\\nThreadSanitizers Sanitizer Special Case List\\nor with\\nThreadSanitizers no_sanitize(â\\x80\\x9cthreadâ\\x80\\x9d)\\nand use the option\\n--fsanitize-blacklist\\n.\\nResulting context:\\nHigher chance to find data races and deadlocks in production code before deploying it.\\nAnalysis result may lack reliability, tool in beta phase stage (in case of ThreadSanitizer).\\nOverhead due to production code instrumentation (maintenance of separate branches for instrumented/not instrumented production code, etc.).\\nInstrumented code needs more memory per thread (in case of ThreadSanitizer).\\nInstrumented code maps a lot virtual address space (in case of ThreadSanitizer).'},\n",

CMake\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS 2 uses ament as the build system but for backward compatibility ROS 2 has a package called\\ncatkin\\nwhich provides almost the same API as catkin in ROS 1.\\nIn order to use this backward compatibility API the\\nCMakeLists.txt\\nmust only be updated to call the function\\ncatkin_ament_package()\\nafter\\nall targets.\\nNOTE: This has not been implemented yet and is only an idea at the moment.\\nDue to the number of changes related to dependencies it has not yet been decided if this compatibility API is useful enough to justify the effort.\\nUpdate source code\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nMessages, services, and actions\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe namespace of ROS 2 messages, services, and actions use a subnamespace (\\nmsg\\n,\\nsrv\\n, or\\naction\\n, respectively) after the package name.\\nTherefore an include looks like:\\n#include\\n<my_interfaces/msg/my_message.hpp>\\n.\\nThe C++ type is then named:\\nmy_interfaces::msg::MyMessage\\n.\\nShared pointer types are provided as typedefs within the message structs:\\nmy_interfaces::msg::MyMessage::SharedPtr\\nas well as\\nmy_interfaces::msg::MyMessage::ConstSharedPtr\\n.\\nFor more details please see the article about the\\ngenerated C++ interfaces\\n.\\nThe migration requires includes to change by:\\ninserting the subfolder\\nmsg\\nbetween the package name and message datatype\\nchanging the included filename from CamelCase to underscore separation\\nchanging from\\n*.h\\nto\\n*.hpp\\n// ROS 1 style is in comments, ROS 2 follows, uncommented.\\n// # include

point_stamped;\\ngeometry_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nPointStamped\\npoint_stamped\\n;\\nThe migration requires code to insert the\\nmsg\\nnamespace into all instances.\\nUse of service objects\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nService callbacks in ROS 2 do not have boolean return values.\\nInstead of returning false on failures, throwing exceptions is recommended.\\n// ROS 1 style is in comments, ROS

ROS 1, parameters are associated with a central server that allowed retrieving parameters at runtime through the use of the network APIs.\\nIn ROS 2, parameters are associated per node and are configurable at runtime with ROS services.\\nSee\\nROS 2 Parameter design document\\nfor more details about the system model.\\nSee\\nROS 2 CLI usage\\nfor a better understanding of how the CLI tools

here):\\n.\\n~/ros1_talker/install/setup.bash\\nroscore\\nIn another shell, we run the node from the\\ncatkin\\ninstall space using\\nrosrun\\n, again sourcing the setup file first (in this case it must be the one\\nfrom our workspace):\\n.\\n~/ros1_talker/install/setup.bash\\nrosrun\\ntalker\\ntalker\\nMigrating to ROS 2\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s start by creating a new workspace in which to work:\\nmkdir\\n~/ros2_talker\\ncd\\n~/ros2_talker\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ll copy the source tree from our ROS 1 package into that workspace, where we can modify it:\\nmkdir\\nsrc\\ncp\\n-a\\n~/ros1_talker/src/talker\\nsrc\\nNow weâ\\x80\\x99ll modify the C++ code in the node.\\nThe ROS 2 C++ library, called\\nrclcpp\\n, provides a different API from that\\nprovided by\\nroscpp\\n.\\nThe concepts are very similar between the two libraries, which makes the changes\\nreasonably straightforward to make.\\nIncluded headers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn place of\\nros/ros.h\\n, which gave us access to the\\nroscpp\\nlibrary API, we\\nneed to include\\nrclcpp/rclcpp.hpp\\n, which gives us access to the\\nrclcpp\\nlibrary API:\\n//#include \"ros/ros.h\"\\n#include\\n\"rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp\"\\nTo get the\\nstd_msgs/String\\nmessage definition, in place of\\nstd_msgs/String.h\\n, we need to include\\nstd_msgs/msg/string.hpp\\n:\\n//#include \"std_msgs/String.h\"\\n#include\\n\"std_msgs/msg/string.hpp\"\\nChanging C++ library calls\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nInstead of passing the nodeâ\\x80\\x99s name to the library initialization call, we do\\nthe initialization, then pass the node name to the creation of the node object\\n(we can use the\\nauto\\nkeyword because now weâ\\x80\\x99re requiring a C++14 compiler):\\n//  ros::init(argc, argv, \"talker\");\\n//  ros::NodeHandle n;\\nrclcpp\\n::\\ninit\\n(\\nargc\\n,\\nargv\\n);\\nauto\\nnode\\n=\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nNode\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n(\\n\"talker\"\\n);\\nThe creation of the publisher and rate objects looks pretty similar, with some\\nchanges to the names of namespace and methods.\\n//  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>(\"chatter\", 1000);\\n//  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);\\nauto\\nchatter_pub\\n=\\nnode\\n->\\ncreate_publisher\\n<\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nString\\n>\\n(\\n\"chatter\"\\n,\\n1000\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nRate\\nloop_rate\\n(\\n10\\n);\\nTo further control how message delivery is handled, a quality of service\\n(\\nQoS\\n) profile could be passed in.\\nThe default profile is\\nrmw_qos_profile_default\\n.\\nFor more details, see the\\ndesign document\\nand\\nconcept overview\\n.\\nThe creation of the outgoing message is different in the namespace:\\n//  std_msgs::String msg;\\nstd_msgs\\n::\\nmsg\\n::\\nString\\nmsg\\n;\\nIn place of\\nros::ok()\\n, we call\\nrclcpp::ok()\\n:\\n//  while (ros::ok())\\nwhile\\n(\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nok\\n())\\nInside the publishing loop, we access the\\ndata\\nfield as before:\\nmsg\\n.\\ndata\\n=\\nss\\n.\\nstr\\n();\\nTo print a console message, instead of using\\nROS_INFO()\\n, we use\\nRCLCPP_INFO()\\nand its various cousins.\\nThe key difference is that\\nRCLCPP_INFO()\\ntakes a Logger object as the first\\nargument.\\n//    ROS_INFO(\"%s\", msg.data.c_str());\\nRCLCPP_INFO\\n(\\nnode\\n->\\nget_logger\\n(),\\n\"%s\\n\\\\n\\n\"\\n,\\nmsg\\n.\\ndata\\n.\\nc_str\\n());\\nPublishing the message is the same as before:\\nchatter_pub\\n->\\npublish\\n(\\nmsg\\n);\\nSpinning (i.e., letting the communications system process any pending\\nincoming/outgoing messages) is different in that the call now takes the node as\\nan argument:\\n//    ros::spinOnce();\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nspin_some\\n(\\nnode\\n);\\nSleeping using the rate object is unchanged.\\nPutting it all together, the new\\ntalker.cpp\\nlooks like this:\\n#include\\n<sstream>\\n// #include \"ros/ros.h\"\\n#include\\n\"rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp\"\\n// #include

what\\nkind\\nof package we are, so that it knows how\\nto build us.\\nBecause weâ\\x80\\x99re using\\nament\\nand CMake, we add the following lines to declare our\\nbuild type to be\\nament_cmake\\n:\\n<export>\\n<build_type>\\nament_cmake\\n</build_type>\\n</export>\\nPutting it all together, our\\npackage.xml\\nnow looks like this:\\n<!-- <package>

To do so, browse to the cmake section, e.g., navigate to the\\nbuild binarydeb\\nsection through the menu on the left in case of a ubuntu/debian build job.

Because of this, we always recommend using a short path name for the root of your ROS 2 directory, like\\nC:\\\\dev\\n.\\nWhen building ROS 2 from source, the default isolated build mode of colcon can generate very long path names. To avoid these very long path names, use\\n--merge-install\\nwhen building on Windows.\\nNote\\n: It is possible to change Windows to have much longer maximum path lengths.\\nSee\\nthis article\\nfor more information.\\nSymbol Visibility\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler (MSVC) exposes symbols from a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) only if they are explicitly exported.\\nThe clang and gcc compilers have an option to do the same, but it is off by default.\\nAs a result, when a library previously built on Linux is built on Windows, other libraries may be unable to resolve the external symbols.\\nBelow are examples of common error messages which can be caused by symbols not being exposed:\\nerror C2448: \\'__attribute__\\': function-style initializer appears to be a function definition\\n\\'visibility\\': identifier not found\\nCMake Error at C:/ws_ros2/install/random_numbers/share/random_numbers/cmake/ament_cmake_export_libraries-extras.cmake:48 (message):\\nPackage \\'random_numbers\\' exports the library \\'random_numbers\\' which\\ncouldn\\'t be found\\nSymbol Visibility also impacts binary loading.\\nIf you are finding that a composible node does not run or a Qt Visualizer isnâ\\x80\\x99t working, it may be that the hosting process can not find an expected symbol export from the binary.\\nTo diagnose this on Windows, the Windows developer tools includes a program called Gflags to enable various options.\\nOne of those options is called\\nLoader Snaps\\nwhich enables you to detect load failures while debugging.\\nPlease visit the Microsoft Documentation for more information on\\nGflags\\nand\\nLoaders snaps\\n.\\nTwo solutions to export symbols on Windows are Visibility Control Headers and the\\nWINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\\nproperty.\\nMicrosoft recommends ROS developers use Visibility Control Headers to control the export of symbols from a binary.\\nVisibility Control Headers provide more control over the symbol export macro and offer other benefits including smaller binary size and reduced link times.\\nVisibility Control Headers\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe purpose of Visibility Control Headers headers is to define a macro for each shared library which correctly declares symbols as dllimport or dllexport.\\nThis is decided based on whether the library is being consumed or being built itself.\\nThe logic in the macro also takes the compiler into account and includes logic to select the appropriate syntax.\\nThe\\nGCC visibility documentation\\nincludes step by step instructions for adding explicit symbol visibility to a library â\\x80\\x9cyielding the highest quality code with the greatest reductions in binary size, load times and link timesâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nA header named\\nvisibility_control.h\\ncan be placed in the\\nincludes\\nfolder for each library as shown in the example below.\\nThe example below shows how a visibility control header would be added for a\\nmy_lib\\nlibrary with a class called\\nexample_class\\n.\\nAdd a visibility header to the include folder for the library.\\nThe boiler plate logic is used with the library name used in the macro to make it unique in the project.\\nIn another library,\\nMY_LIB\\nwould be replaced with the library name.\\n#ifndef MY_LIB__VISIBILITY_CONTROL_H_\\n#define MY_LIB__VISIBILITY_CONTROL_H_\\n#if defined _WIN32 || defined __CYGWIN__\\n#ifdef __GNUC__\\n#define MY_LIB_EXPORT __attribute__ ((dllexport))\\n#define MY_LIB_IMPORT __attribute__ ((dllimport))\\n#else\\n#define MY_LIB_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)\\n#define MY_LIB_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)\\n#endif\\n#ifdef MY_LIB_BUILDING_LIBRARY\\n#define MY_LIB_PUBLIC MY_LIB_EXPORT\\n#else\\n#define MY_LIB_PUBLIC MY_LIB_IMPORT\\n#endif\\n#define MY_LIB_PUBLIC_TYPE MY_LIB_PUBLIC\\n#define MY_LIB_LOCAL\\n#else\\n// Linux visibility settings\\n#define MY_LIB_PUBLIC_TYPE\\n#endif\\n#endif\\n// MY_LIB__VISIBILITY_CONTROL_H_\\nFor a complete example of this header, see\\nrviz_rendering\\n.\\nTo use the macro, add\\nMY_LIB_PUBLIC\\nbefore symbols which need to be visible to external libraries. For example:\\nClass\\nMY_LIB_PUBLIC\\nexample_class\\n{}\\nMY_LIB_PUBLIC\\nvoid\\nexample_function\\n(){}\\nIn order to build your library with correctly exported symbols, you will need to add the following to your CMakeLists.txt file:\\ntarget_compile_definitions\\n(\\n${\\nPROJECT_NAME\\n}\\nPRIVATE\\n\"MY_LIB_BUILDING_LIBRARY\"\\n)\\nWINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS Target Property\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nCMake implements the\\nWINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\\nproperty on Windows, which causes function symbols to be automatically exported.\\nMore detail of how it works can be found in the\\nWINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS CMake Documentation\\n.\\nThe property can be implemented by adding the following to the CMakeLists file:\\nset_target_properties\\n(\\n${\\nLIB_NAME\\n}\\nPROPERTIES\\nWINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\\nTRUE\\n)\\nIf there is more than one library in a CMakeLists file you will need to call\\nset_target_properties\\non each of them separately.\\nNote that a binary on Windows can only export 65,536 symbols.\\nIf a binary exports more than that, you will get an error and should use the visibility_control headers.\\nThere is an exception to this method in the case of global data symbols.\\nFor example, a global static data member like the one below.\\nclass\\nExample_class\\n{\\npublic\\n:\\nstatic\\nconst\\nint\\nGlobal_data_num\\n;\\nIn these cases dllimprort/dllexport must be applied explicitly.\\nThis can be done using generate_export_header as described in the following article:\\nCreate dlls on Windows without declspec() using new CMake export all feature\\n.\\nFinally, it is important that the header file that exports the symbols be included into at least one of the\\n.cpp\\nfiles in the package so that the macros will get expanded and placed into the resulting binary.\\nOtherwise the symbols will still not be callable.\\nDebug builds\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen building in Debug mode on Windows, several very important things change.\\nThe first is that all DLLs get\\n_d\\nautomatically appended to the library name.\\nSo if the library is called\\nlibfoo.dll\\n, in Debug mode it will be\\nlibfoo_d.dll\\n.\\nThe dynamic linker on Windows also knows to look for libraries of that form, so it will not find libraries without the\\n_d\\nprefix.\\nAdditionally, Windows turns on a whole set of compile-time and run-time checks in Debug mode that is far more strict than Release builds.\\nFor these reasons, it is a good idea to run a Windows Debug build and test on many pull requests.\\nForward-slash vs. back-slash\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn Windows the default path separator is a backslash (\\n\\\\\\n), which differs from the forward-slash (\\n/\\n) used in Linux and macOS.\\nMost of the Windows APIs can deal with either as a path separator, but this is not universally true.\\nFor instance, the\\ncmd.exe\\nshell can only do tab-completion when using the backslash character, not the forward-slash.\\nFor maximum compatibility on Windows, a backslash should always be used as the path separator on Windows.\\nPatching vendored packages\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nWhen vendoring a package in ROS 2, it is often necessary to apply a patch to fix a bug, add a feature, etc.\\nThe typical way to do this is to modify the\\nExternalProject_add\\ncall to add a\\nPATCH\\ncommand, using the\\npatch\\nexecutable.\\nUnfortunately, the\\npatch\\nexecutable as delivered by chocolatey requires Administrator access to run.\\nThe workaround is to use\\ngit\\napply-patch\\nwhen applying patches to external projects.\\ngit\\napply-patch\\nhas its own issues in that it only works properly when applied to a git repository.\\nFor that reason, external projects should always use the\\nGIT\\nmethod to obtain the project and then use the\\nPATCH_COMMAND\\nto invoke\\ngit\\napply-patch\\n.\\nAn example usage of all of the above looks something like:\\nExternalProject_Add\\n(\\nmylibrary-\\n${\\nversion\\n}\\nGIT_REPOSITORY\\nhttps://github.com/lib/mylibrary.git\\nGIT_TAG\\n${\\nversion\\n}\\nGIT_CONFIG\\nadvice.detachedHead=false\\n# Suppress git update due to https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/16419\\n# See https://github.com/ament/uncrustify_vendor/pull/22 for

slow timers (slowness in general)\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nSoftware running on Windows is, in general, much slower than that running on Linux.\\nThis is due to a number of factors, from the default time slice (every 20 ms, according to the\\ndocumentation\\n), to the number of anti-virus and anti-malware processes running, to the number of background processes running.\\nBecause of all of this, tests should\\nnever\\nexpect tight timing on Windows.\\nAll tests should have generous timeouts, and only expect events to happen eventually (this will also prevent tests from being flakey on Linux).\\nShells\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are two main command-line shells on Windows: the venerable\\ncmd.exe\\n, and PowerShell.\\ncmd.exe\\nis the command shell that most closely emulates the old DOS shell, though with greatly enhanced capabilities.\\nIt is completely text based, and only understands DOS/Windows\\nbatch\\nfiles.\\nPowerShell is the newer, object-based shell that Microsoft recommends for most new applications.\\nIt understands\\nps1\\nfiles for configuration.\\nROS 2 supports both\\ncmd.exe\\nand PowerShell, so any changes (especially to things like\\nament\\nor\\ncolcon\\n) should be tested on both.'},\n",

the\\nconf.py\\nfile and change the\\nsmv_branch_whitelist\\nvariable to point to your branch.\\nChecking for broken links\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTo check for broken links on the site, run:\\nmake linkcheck\\nThis will check the entire site for broken links, and output the results to the screen and\\nbuild/linkcheck\\n.\\nWriting pages\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS 2 documentation website uses the\\nreStructuredText\\nformat, which is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.\\nThis section is a brief introduction to\\nreStructuredText\\nconcepts, syntax, and best practices.\\nYou can refer to\\nreStructuredText User Documentation\\nfor a detailed technical specification.\\nTable of Contents\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are two types of directives used for the generation of a table of contents,\\n..\\ntoctree::\\nand\\n..\\ncontents::\\n.\\nThe\\n..\\ntoctree::\\nis used in top-level pages like\\nTutorials.rst\\nto set ordering and visibility of its child pages.\\nThis directive creates both left navigation panel and in-page navigation links to the child pages listed.\\nIt helps readers to understand the structure of separate documentation sections and navigate between pages.\\n..\\ntoctree\\n::\\n:maxdepth:\\n1\\nThe\\n..\\ncontents::\\ndirective is used for the generation of a table of contents for that particular page.\\nIt parses all present headings in a page and builds an in-page nested table of contents.\\nIt helps readers to see an overview of the content and navigate inside a page.\\nThe\\n..\\ncontents::\\ndirective supports the definition of maximum depth of nested sections.\\nUsing\\n:depth:\\n2\\nwill only show Sections and Subsections in the table of contents.\\n..\\ncontents\\n::\\nTable of Contents\\n:depth:\\n2\\n:local:\\nHeadings\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThere are four main Heading types used in the documentation.\\nNote that the number of symbols has to match the length of the title.\\nPage Title Header\\n=================\\nSection Header\\n--------------\\n2 Subsection Header\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n2.4 Subsubsection Header\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nWe usually use one digit for numbering subsections and two digits (dot separated) for numbering subsubsections in Tutorials and How-To-Guides.\\nLists\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nStars\\n*\\nare used for listing unordered items with bullet points and number sign\\n#.\\nis used for listing numbered items.\\nBoth of them support nested definitions and will render accordingly.\\n*\\nbullet point\\n*\\nbullet point nested\\n*\\nbullet point nested\\n*\\nbullet point\\n#.\\nfirst listed item\\n#.\\nsecond lited item\\nCode Formatting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nIn-text code can be formatted using\\nbackticks\\nfor showing\\nhighlighted\\ncode.\\nIn-text code can be formatted using\\n``backticks``\\nfor showing\\n``highlighted``\\ncode.\\nCode blocks inside a page need to be captured using\\n..\\ncode-block::\\ndirective.\\n..\\ncode-block::\\nsupports code highlighting for syntaxes like\\nC++\\n,\\nYAML\\n,\\nconsole\\n,\\nbash\\n, and more.\\nCode inside the directive needs to be indented.\\n..\\ncode-block\\n::\\nC++\\nint\\nmain\\n(\\nint\\nargc\\n,\\nchar\\n**\\nargv\\n)\\n{\\nrclcpp\\n::\\ninit\\n(\\nargc\\n,\\nargv\\n);\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nspin\\n(\\nstd\\n::\\nmake_shared\\n<\\nParametersClass\\n>\\n());\\nrclcpp\\n::\\nshutdown\\n();\\nreturn\\n0\\n;\\n}\\nImages\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nImages

links to external web pages is shown below.\\n`ROS Docs\\n<https://docs.ros.org>\\n`_\\nThe above link will appear as\\nROS Docs\\n.\\nNote the underscore after the final single quote.\\nInternal links\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe\\n:doc:\\ndirective is used to create in-text links to other pages.\\n:doc:\\n`Quality of Service <../Tutorials/Quality-of-Service>`\\nNote that the relative path to the file is used.\\nThe\\nref\\ndirective is used to make links to specific parts of a page.\\nThese could be headings, images or code sections inside the current or different page.\\nDefinition of explicit target right before the desired object is required.\\nIn the example below, the target is defined as\\n_talker-listener\\none line before the heading\\nTry\\nsome\\nexamples\\n.\\n..\\n_talker-listener:\\nTry some examples\\n-----------------\\nNow the link from any page in the documentation to that header can be created.\\n:ref:\\n`talker-listener demo <talker-listener>`\\nThis link will navigate a reader to the target page with an HTML anchor link\\n#talker-listener\\n.\\nMacros\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nMacros can be used to simplify writing documentation that targets multiple distributions.\\nUse a macro by including the macro name in curly braces.\\nFor example, when generating the docs for Rolling on the\\nrolling\\nbranch:\\nUse\\nBecomes (for Rolling)\\nExample\\n{DISTRO}\\nrolling\\nros-{DISTRO}-pkg\\n{DISTRO_TITLE}\\nRolling\\nROS 2 {DISTRO_TITLE}\\n{DISTRO_TITLE_FULL}\\nRolling Ridley\\nROS 2 {DISTRO_TITLE_FULL}\\n{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}\\nrolling\\ngit checkout {REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}\\nThe same file can be used on multiple branches (i.e., for multiple distros) and the generated content will be distro-specific.\"},\n",

TSC\\nEstablishment of the TSC\\nCommunity representation\\nMeetings\\nWorking Groups\\nVoting\\nProject Roles\\nConfidentiality\\nGuiding Principles & Rationale\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS 2 Project (â\\x80\\x9cROS 2â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cthe projectâ\\x80\\x9d) operates openly, such that plans, decisions, and processes are freely available to the general public in a timely manner.\\nAll interested parties should have access to information about the project direction and timeline, from casual observers to companies planning product releases.\\nResponsibilities of the TSC\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe ROS 2 Technical Steering Committee (â\\x80\\x9cTSCâ\\x80\\x9d) is responsible for the technical direction that the project takes.\\nThe TSC makes decisions on the project roadmap, developer policies and process, release schedule, and other matters that require technical supervision in ROS 2.\\nIt is intended that these decisions be final and authoritative, but successful implementation of any decision depends on commitment of the necessary resources from the organizations represented on the TSC.\\nThe TSC aims to ensure the following characteristics of the project:\\nIndependent and transparent governance\\nThe project is driven by the community that contributes to and uses the resulting software, with Open Robotics as the founding project sponsor.\\nCoordination\\nThose individuals and organizations that are contributing the labor and other resources to develop the project are in regular contact with each other to coordinate their plans and activities.\\nPace & quality\\nThe project advances as quickly as possible given the available resources and without sacrificing quality in the resulting software.\\nPolicies\\nContributions to the project are received, reviewed, and tested in a manner that is consistent with the requirements for widespread adoption of the resulting software in industry.\\nEstablishment of the TSC\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC is made up of individuals who contribute materially to the project and/or individuals who represent organizations that contribute materially to the project and/or selected community representatives.\\nThe TSC seeks to coordinate the contributions that members and their organizations are voluntarily making to the project.\\nThe TSC cannot compel or oblige any action on the part of a member, his or her organization, or that organizationâ\\x80\\x99s employees.\\nMaterial contribution is the commitment of a minimum level of effort toward developing software and/or documentation that is contributed to the project under the appropriate open source license.\\nThis contribution may be in the form of in-kind labor and/or outsourced work.\\nNo fees or payments beyond material contribution to the project are required for TSC membership.\\nThe minimum level of effort commitment required to qualify for TSC membership is\\n1 full-time equivalent (FTE)\\n.\\nThis level may be changed by the TSC via a standard TSC motion and vote.\\nThe TSC must have at least three members.\\nTSC membership is not time-limited.\\nThere is no maximum size for the TSC.\\nA size limit may be established by the TSC via a standard TSC motion and vote.\\nThe TSC may add additional members to the TSC by a standard TSC motion and vote.\\nWhen considering the addition of a new member, the TSC is responsible for determining whether that potential memberâ\\x80\\x99s material contributions to the project are appropriate and sufficient to qualify for membership.\\nA TSC member may be removed from the TSC by voluntary resignation, by a standard TSC motion and vote, or in accordance with the following participation rule:\\nIn the case where an individual TSC member â\\x80\\x93 within any three-month period â\\x80\\x93 attends fewer than 1â\\x81\\x843 of the regularly scheduled meetings, does not participate in TSC discussions, and does not participate in TSC votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the TSC.\\nThe TSC will periodically review the material contributions of TSC members to ensure that they continue to meet the minimum level of effort established by the TSC for TSC membership.\\nIn the case where a TSC memberâ\\x80\\x99s material contributions fall below that minimum level, the TSC may decide to remove that TSC member by a standard TSC motion and vote.\\nWith the exception of Open Robotics, there may be at most one TSC member from any single employer.\\nA TSC member may designate a proxy to participate in the TSC on that memberâ\\x80\\x99s behalf.\\nTSC membership is public; the membership list is published via a website that Open Robotics maintains and updates periodically.\\nOpen Robotics, as the founding sponsor of the project, has permanent membership on the TSC, hosts TSC meetings, and provides a representative to serve as chairperson.\\nAny organization or individual may apply for membership on the TSC by email to\\ninfo\\n@\\nopenrobotics\\n.\\norg\\n.\\nThe ROS 2 TSC applicant intake process is\\nhere\\n.\\nCommunity representation\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC shall include a number of individuals who represent the broader ROS community rather than any particular organisation or individual.\\nThe number of community representatives shall be set by a decision of the TSC.\\nHowever, this number shall not be less than three, and shall also not be less than 10% of the number of non-community representative members in the TSC.\\nA community representative serves for two years.\\nThe term of service begins on the 1st of December immediately following an election.\\nFifty percent (50%) of the initial set of community representatives shall serve for only one year in their first term to stagger the community representative terms.\\nA community representative may be removed from the TSC earlier than two years if one of the following conditions is met:\\nThe community representative requests to stand down voluntarily.\\nThe TSC chairperson deems that the community representative has behaved inappropriately.\\nThe TSC chairperson must make public the reason for standing down the community representative.\\nWhen a community representative is removed from the TSC:\\nIf the number of community representatives is below the specified minimum, the TSC shall recommend and the chairperson shall appoint a new community representative to serve the remainder of the removed community representativeâ\\x80\\x99s term.\\nIf the number of community representatives is above the specified minimum, no special action shall be taken.\\nA community representative is selected via an open election.\\nAn individual is eligible to stand for election as a community representative if:\\nThe maximum number of community representatives from any single organisation is one.\\nThe individual has voluntarily nominated themselves.\\nThat individualâ\\x80\\x99s nomination has not been vetoed by the TSC chairperson.\\nCommunity representative elections shall be held in the following manner:\\nOn the first Tuesday of September a ROS Discourse post will be made asking for TSC member nominations.\\nThe nomination period will last two weeks until the third Tuesday in September.\\nProspective TSC member nominees must self nominate, but the community is encouraged to use the nomination Discourse thread to encourage other community members to run.\\nTo self-nominate prospective TSC members must submit a candidate packet that includes a written biography, headshot, a written statement, and optionally a short video introduction.\\nThe written statement shall state why the candidate believes themselves suitable and what they intend to accomplish as a community representative.\\nBetween the third Tuesday in September and the first Tuesday in October the ROS 2 TSC will review the candidates for any objections or conflicts of interest.\\nThe TSC chair will prepare a ROS Discourse post that includes all of the candidate packets.\\nOn the first Tuesday of October the candidate packets will be posted to ROS Discourse along with with the online balloting form.\\nThe period between the start of the election process and the close of voting may be used for campaigning by candidates.\\nThe eligibility criteria for voters shall be determined by the TSC prior to commencing an election and clearly stated in the election information from the start of nominations until the close of voting.\\nBalloting will be open from the first Tuesday in October until the end of the first full day of ROSCon.\\nBalloting shall be conducted using the Condorcet method.\\nCandidates are encouraged, but not required, to attend ROSCon.\\nThe results of the election shall be announced during the closing session of ROSCon along with an announcement post on ROS Discourse.\\nIn the event that ROSCon is not held during a given calendar year for any reason, then the foregoing election process shall still be followed, with procedural modifications as necessary, at a time of the TSCâ\\x80\\x99s choosing, but with the results being announced no later than the 15th of December.\\nMeetings\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC meets regularly in-person and/or via an electronic means.\\nA minimum of three TSC members is required to establish a quorum to hold a TSC meeting.\\nParticipation in a TSC meeting is open to current members.\\nOther organizations or individuals may be invited by Open Robotics to observe a TSC meeting.\\nTSC members may suggest to Open Robotics the names of individuals or organizations for consideration as potential observers.\\nMinutes from each TSC meeting are published by Open Robotics shortly after the meeting.\\nTSC meetings are not broadcast or recorded verbatim, but they should be treated as public discussions.\\nWorking Groups\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC may establish one or more working groups (â\\x80\\x9cWGsâ\\x80\\x9d) to discuss specific topics in greater detail than is practical for the TSC as a whole.\\nA WG may be established by the TSC via standard TSC motion and vote.\\nAt the time of such establishment, the TSC is responsible for deciding the name, scope, and initial chair of the new WG.\\nA WG may be dissolved by the TSC via standard TSC motion and vote.\\nEach WG must be chaired by a TSC member.\\nThe chair of a WG is responsible for all aspects of that WGâ\\x80\\x99s operation, including membership, meeting schedule, and decision-making.\\nA WG may bring findings and/or recommendations to the TSC for discussion and/or decision.\\nVoting\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC aims to operate by consensus.\\nWhen consensus cannot be reached, decisions should in most cases be made by resource commitment: e.g., if a member wants to include a feature on the roadmap but the rest of the TSC is uninterested, then that member can choose to commit his or her organizationâ\\x80\\x99s contribution to development of the desired feature and thereby have it included in the roadmap.\\nIn cases where consensus cannot be reached and resource commitment is insufficient or inappropriate, simple majority voting is used, with each member having one vote.\\nProject Roles\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nTSC membership does not influence the handling of code contributions, which continues to follow the established federated development model in which contributions are made by pull request and reviewed and approved by the appropriate maintainer(s) prior to merging.\\nCommit rights and maintainer status are earned through code contributions to the relevant package(s).\\nConfidentiality\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe TSC is set up to transparently guide the community.\\nHowever, to facilitate effective communication, the ability to have some confidential discussions is important.\\nTSC members should share confidential information within the TSC and other members are expected to respect that confidentiality.\\nThe following are rules regarding confidentiality in TSC communications, events, and meetings.\\nAll other communications may be made freely available to the broader community for transparency.\\nBreaking the rules in this section is sufficient, but not necessary, causality for expulsion of the representative or member company, depending on the nature of the infraction, from the TSC by a standard motion and vote.\\nStatements made by individuals in discussions surrounding a vote or topic of contention which are not reflected in the publicly posted minutes should be considered confidential.\\nStatements made by individuals regarding companies, research groups, individuals, or other entities for which they are not also members should be considered confidential.\\nThis is exempt when the entity in question is a member and in attendance to the TSC meeting or event.\\nStatements made in obvious confidence or explicitly stated as confidential regarding their own entity or opinions should remain confidential.\\nRule a-c may be waived by the TSC member who made the statement only by explicit verbal or written approval.\\nIf the existence of a waiver is put into question by either party, this waiver is considered nullified.\\nAffiliates of TSC member organizations or guests of TSC events privy to confidential information will be held to the same standards set out in this section.\\nIt is the responsibility of the TSC member issuing invitations or sharing information to inform relevant parties of these confidentiality requirements.\\nIf this policy is broken, the TSC member is in full responsibility for the disclosure.\"},\n",

We\\nsuggest having at minimum three people who can help orchestrate the working\\ngroup.\\nDraft up a one page summary of your working group. This summary should\\nbroadly cover what topics you would like to cover and what goals you would\\nlike to accomplish. Take a look at the other working groups and make sure\\nthat you donâ\\x80\\x99t overlap too much.\\nOnce you have your ideas roughly distilled take it to the ROS community to\\nfind more like minded members. We generally recommend making a post on\\nROS\\ndiscourse\\non the general channel with the title â\\x80\\x9cProposal for ROS X Working\\nGroupâ\\x80\\x9d. Include your summary and your current collaborators. You should use\\nthis thread to:\\nFinalize the subjects covered by your working group.\\nRecruit members for your working group.\\nSet the agenda for your first couple of working group meetings.\\nPick a regular time for your working group meetings (we find that early in\\nthe morning PST, generally works for most of the world).  At this point\\nyou should also make a discourse tag (you use these when you make your\\npost.  We suggest something like: â\\x80\\x9cwg-<topic>â\\x80\\x9d.\\nOnce you have recruited your working group members youâ\\x80\\x99ll have some leg work\\nto do. At this point you should have a list of working group members. Create\\na google group by going to Google groups\\n(\\nhttps://groups.google.com/my-groups\\n) and adding your members.\\nThis mailing list should be named\\n<dashed-name>-working-group-invites@googlegroups.com\\n.\\nIt should be setup such that:\\nAnyone can join\\nNo one can post (aka only owners)\\nAnyone can view members\\nThe mailing list will be used to distribute the invitations only, any communications should use\\nROS discourse\\nwith the working groupâ\\x80\\x99s tag.\\nPlease add\\ntfoote\\n@\\nosrfoundation\\n.\\norg\\nas an owner of the mailing list to help with administration.\\nNow that you have an e-mail group you can associate that group with the ROS\\nevents calendar. The calendar is where you will schedule your working group\\nmeetings. To join the calendar, send an e-mail request to Kat\\n(\\nkat\\n@\\nopenrobotics\\n.\\norg\\n) or Tully (\\ntfoote\\n@\\nopenrobotics\\n.\\norg\\n).\\nTo formalize your group you need to create a working group charter and a git\\nrepository to keep your documents and code. We have a working group template\\nthat can be found\\nhere\\n. Anyone in\\nthe group can host the template or you can request that your group be added\\nto the Open Robotics / OSRF organization. The decision is up to the working group.\\nNow that you have a working group charter, e-mail group, and source\\nrepository, you can add all of that information to the\\nROS 2 project governance\\nwebsite\\nby sending a pull request to\\nhttps://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation\\n.\\nNow it is time to schedule your first official working group meeting! We\\nrecommend announcing the meeting on ROS Discourse approximately one week\\nbefore the meeting date. Please include the following in your an announcement:\\nAn agenda for the meeting.\\nThe date and time for the meeting (protip: discourse has a date/time feature\\nthat can auto adjust for each userâ\\x80\\x99s timezone).\\nURLs / Links / Contact Info for the meeting. Open Robotics uses Google\\nHangouts, but you can use whatever technology you would like.\\nWhen you schedule your meeting, create an event on the ROS Calendar and invite the Google group so that anyone interested can sign up for automatic invitations.\\nHave your meetings! Regularly!\\nSince we are a global community it can help to record your meetings. If\\nyou have an invited lecture we highly recommend recording it for the\\nbenefit of the whole community. Make sure the group / lecturer consents to\\nbeing recorded, and it is wise to do a test run before the event.\\nOn Linux SimpleScreenRecorder works well but you may need to iterate to\\nfind the best combination of video conferencing platform, screen\\nrecorder, and settings.\\nOnce your meeting is over, find somewhere online to save the\\nvideo. Feel free to use your own Youtube channel to post the video;\\nalternatively Open Robotics can host the video on their Vimeo account\\nby sending a download link to\\nkat\\n@\\nopenrobotics\\n.\\norg\\n.\\nMake sure to take notes! You should nominate a scribe or note taker who\\nsummarizes the meeting and posts the results of the meeting to discourse.\"},\n",

APIs are made up of files that define a contract between the software using the interface and the software providing the interface. These files typically manifest as header files in C and C++ and as Python files in Python. In either case it is important that APIs are grouped and described in documentation and that they are declared as either public or private. Public interfaces are subject to change rules and changes to the public interfaces prompt a new version number of the software that provides them.\\nclient_library\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA client library is an\\nAPI\\nthat provides access to the ROS graph using primitive middleware concepts like Topics, Services, and Actions.\\npackage\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA single unit of software, including source code, build system files, documentation, tests, and other associated resources.\\nREP\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nROS Enhancement Proposal. A document that describes an enhancement, standardization, or convention for the ROS community.\\nThe associated REP approval process allows the community to iterate on a proposal until some consensus has been made, at which point it can be ratified and implemented, at which point it becomes documentation.\\nAll REPs are viewable from the\\nREP index\\n.\\nVCS\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nVersion Control System, such as CVS, SVN, git, mercurial, etcâ\\x80¦\\nrclcpp\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nThe C++ specific\\nClient Library\\nfor ROS. This includes any middleware related APIs as well as the related message generation of C++ data structures based on interface definitions like Messages, Services, and Actions.\\nrepository\\nï\\x83\\x81\\nA collection of packages usually managed using a\\nVCS\\nlike git or mercurial and usually hosted on a site like GitHub or BitBucket.\\nIn the context of this document repositories usually contain one or more\\npackages\\nof one type or another.\"}]"
