topics.\\n**Tutorial level:** Beginner\\n**Time:** 20 minutes\\n:depth: 2\\n:local:\\nBackground\\nROS 2 breaks complex systems down into many modular nodes.\\nTopics are a vital element of the ROS graph that act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages.\\nA node may publish data to any number of topics and simultaneously have subscriptions to any number of topics.\\nTopics are one of the main ways in which data is moved between nodes and therefore between different parts of the system.\\nPrerequisites\\nThe :doc:previous tutorial <../Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes> provides some useful background information on nodes that is built upon here.\\nAs always, don\\'t forget to source ROS 2 in :doc:every new terminal you open <../Configuring-ROS2-Environment>.\\nTasks\\n1 Setup\\n^^^^^^^\\nBy now you should be comfortable starting up turtlesim.\\nOpen a new terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\nOpen another terminal and run:\\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\\nRecall from the :doc:previous tutorial <../Understanding-ROS2-Nodes/Understanding-ROS2-Nodes> that the names of these nodes are /turtlesim and /teleop_turtle by default.\\n2 rqt_graph\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThroughout this tutorial, we will use rqt_graph to visualize the changing nodes and topics, as well as the connections between them.\\nThe :doc:turtlesim tutorial <../Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim> tells you how to install rqt and all its plugins, including rqt_graph.\\nTo run rqt_graph, open a new terminal and enter the command:\\nrqt_graph\\nYou can also open rqt_graph by opening rqt and selecting **Plugins** > **Introspection** > **Node Graph**.\\nYou should see the above nodes and topic, as well as two actions around the periphery of the graph (let\\'s ignore those for now).\\nIf you hover your mouse over the topic in the center, you\\'ll see the color highlighting like in the image above.\\nThe graph is depicting how the /turtlesim node and the /teleop_turtle node are communicating with each other over a topic.\\nThe /teleop_turtle node is publishing data (the keystrokes you enter to move the turtle around) to the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, and the /turtlesim node is subscribed to that topic to receive the data.\\nThe highlighting feature of rqt_graph is very helpful when examining more complex systems with many nodes and topics connected in many different ways.\\nrqt_graph is a graphical introspection tool.\\nNow we\\'ll look at some command line tools for introspecting topics.\\n3 ros2 topic list\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nRunning the ros2 topic list command in a new terminal will return a list of all the topics currently active in the system:\\n/parameter_events\\n/rosout\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\\n/turtle1/color_sensor\\n/turtle1/pose\\nros2 topic list -t will return the same list of topics, this time with the topic type appended in brackets:\\n/parameter_events [rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterEvent]\\n/rosout [rcl_interfaces/msg/Log]\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel [geometry_msgs/msg/Twist]\\n/turtle1/color_sensor [turtlesim_msgs/msg/Color]\\n/turtle1/pose [turtlesim_msgs/msg/Pose]\\nThese attributes, particularly the type, are how nodes know they\\'re talking about the same information as it moves over topics.\\nIf you\\'re wondering where all these topics are in rqt_graph, you can uncheck all the boxes under **Hide:**\\nFor now, though, leave those options checked to avoid confusion.\\n4 ros2 topic echo\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nTo see the data being published on a topic, use:\\nros2 topic echo <topic_name>\\nSince we know that /teleop_turtle publishes data to /turtlesim over the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, let\\'s use echo to introspect that topic:\\nros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel\\nAt first, this command won\\'t return any data.\\nThat\\'s because it\\'s waiting for /teleop_turtle to publish something.\\nReturn to the terminal where turtle_teleop_key is running and use the arrows to move the turtle around.\\nWatch the terminal where your echo is running at the same time, and you\\'ll see position data being published for every movement you make:\\nlinear:\\nx: 2.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\nangular:\\nx: 0.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\n---\\nNow return to rqt_graph and uncheck the **Debug** box.\\n/_ros2cli_26646 is the node created by the echo command we just ran (the number might be different).\\nNow you can see that the publisher is publishing data over the cmd_vel topic, and two subscribers are subscribed to it.\\n5 ros2 topic info\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nTopics don\\'t have to only be one-to-one communication; they can be one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.\\nAnother way to look at this is running:\\nros2 topic info /turtle1/cmd_vel\\nWhich will return:\\nType: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nPublisher count: 1\\nSubscription count: 2\\n6 ros2 interface show\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNodes send data over topics using messages.\\nPublishers and subscribers must send and receive the same type of message to communicate.\\nThe topic types we saw earlier after running ros2 topic list -t let us know what message type is used on each topic.\\nRecall that the cmd_vel topic has the type:\\ngeometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nThis means that in the package geometry_msgs there is a msg called Twist.\\nNow we can run ros2 interface show <msg_type> on this type to learn its details.\\nSpecifically, what structure of data the message expects.\\nros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nFor the message type from above it yields:\\n# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.\\nVector3  linear\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nVector3  angular\\nfloat64 x\\nfloat64 y\\nfloat64 z\\nThis tells you that the /turtlesim node is expecting a message with two vectors, linear and angular, of three elements each.\\nIf you recall the data we saw /teleop_turtle passing to /turtlesim with the echo command, it\\'s in the same structure:\\nlinear:\\nx: 2.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\nangular:\\nx: 0.0\\ny: 0.0\\nz: 0.0\\n---\\n7 ros2 topic pub\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNow that you have the message structure, you can publish data to a topic directly from the command line using:\\nros2 topic pub <topic_name> <msg_type> \\'<args>\\'\\nThe \\'<args>\\' argument is the actual data you\\'ll pass to the topic, in the structure you just discovered in the previous section.\\nThe turtle (and commonly the real robots which it is meant to emulate) require a steady stream of commands to operate continuously.\\nSo, to get the turtle moving, and keep it moving, you can use the following command.\\nIt\\'s important to note that this argument needs to be input in YAML syntax.\\nInput the full command like so:\\nros2 topic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \"{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}\"\\nWith no command-line options, ros2 topic pub publishes the command in a steady stream at 1 Hz.\\nAt times you may want to publish data to your topic only once (rather than continuously).\\nTo publish your command just once add the --once option.\\nros2 topic pub --once -w 2 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \"{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.8}}\"\\n--once is an optional argument meaning “publish one message then exit”.\\n-w 2 is an optional argument meaning “wait for two matching subscriptions”.\\nThis is needed because we have both turtlesim and the topic echo subscribed.\\nYou will see the following output in the terminal:\\nWaiting for at least 2 matching subscription(s)...\\npublisher: beginning loop\\npublishing #1: geometry_msgs.msg.Twist(linear=geometry_msgs.msg.Vector3(x=2.0, y=0.0, z=0.0), angular=geometry_msgs.msg.Vector3(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=1.8))\\nAnd you will see your turtle move like so:\\nYou can refresh rqt_graph to see what\\'s happening graphically.\\nYou will see that the ros2 topic pub ... node (/_ros2cli_30358) is publishing over the /turtle1/cmd_vel topic, which is being received by both the ros2 topic echo ... node (/_ros2cli_26646) and the /turtlesim node now.\\nFinally, you can run echo on the pose topic and recheck rqt_graph:\\nros2 topic echo /turtle1/pose\\nYou can see that the /turtlesim node is also publishing to the pose topic, which the new echo node has subscribed to.\\nWhen publishing messages with timestamps, pub has two methods to automatically fill them out with the current time.\\nFor messages with a std_msgs/msg/Header, the header field can be set to auto to fill out the stamp field.\\nros2 topic pub /pose geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped \\'{header: \"auto\", pose: {position: {x: 1.0, y: 2.0, z: 3.0}}}\\'\\nIf the message does not use a full header, but just has a field with type builtin_interfaces/msg/Time, that can be set to the value now.\\nros2 topic pub /reference sensor_msgs/msg/TimeReference \\'{header: \"auto\", time_ref: \"now\", source: \"dumy\"}\\'\\n8 ros2 topic hz\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nYou can also view the rate at which data is published using:\\nros2 topic hz /turtle1/pose\\nIt will return data on the rate at which the /turtlesim node is publishing data to the pose topic.\\naverage rate: 59.354\\nmin: 0.005s max: 0.027s std dev: 0.00284s window: 58\\nRecall that you set the rate of turtle1/cmd_vel to publish at a steady 1 Hz using ros2 topic pub --rate 1.\\nIf you run the above command with turtle1/cmd_vel instead of turtle1/pose, you will see an average reflecting that rate.\\n9 ros2 topic bw\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe bandwidth used by a topic can be viewed using:\\nros2 topic bw /turtle1/pose\\nIt returns the bandwidth utilization and number of messages being published to the /turtle1/pose topic.\\nSubscribed to [/turtle1/pose]\\n1.51 KB/s from 62 messages\\nMessage size mean: 0.02 KB min: 0.02 KB max: 0.02 KB\\n10 ros2 topic find\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nTo list a list of available topics of a given type use:\\nros2 topic find <topic_type>\\nRecall that the cmd_vel topic has the type:\\ngeometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nUsing the find command outputs topics available when given the message type:\\nros2 topic find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist\\nThis outputs:\\n/turtle1/cmd_vel\\n11 Clean up\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAt this point you\\'ll have a lot of nodes running.\\nDon\\'t forget to stop them by entering Ctrl+C in each terminal.\\nSummary\\nNodes publish information over topics, which allows any number of other nodes to subscribe to and access that information.\\nIn this tutorial you examined the connections between several nodes over topics using rqt_graph and command line tools.\\nYou should now have a good idea of how data moves around a ROS 2 system.\\nNext steps\\nNext you\\'ll learn about another communication type in the ROS graph with the tutorial :doc:../Understanding-ROS2-Services/Understanding-ROS2-Services.',\n",
